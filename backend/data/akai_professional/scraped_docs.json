The lowest and highest notes will sound only once at the directional change. \n Inc Notes are played from the lowest to the highest, and then back \ndown. The lowest and highest notes will sound twice at the directional change. \n Ord Notes are played in the order they are triggered. \n Rnd Notes are played in random order. \n Chor All notes played are triggered together as a chord. \nDiv 1/4, 1/4T, 1/8, 1/8T, \n1/16, 1/16T, 1/32, \n1/32T This determines the time division of the arpeggiator. Notes will be \nplayed at this rate according to the current tempo. A \u201cT\u201d indicates a \ntriplet time division. \nOct 1\u20134 This determines the number of octaves covered by the arpeggiation. \nSwing 50\u201375% This determines the amount of swing applied to notes in the \narpeggiation. \nNote:  This setting also applies to Note Repeat . \nMutate Off, On This turns the mutate function on or off. \nWhen on, an arpeggiator step will occasionally jump up one octave \nfrom its expected octave. \nMut% 0\u201399% This determines the probabilit y of the Mutate effect being applied to \nthe arpeggiation. \nRnd% 1\u201399% This determines the probability that the arp will play a random note \ninstead of the next expected note in the arpeggiation. \nClock Int, Ext This determines whether the apreiggator timing is controlled by the \nInternal clock or by an External clock, such as a connected DAW. \nBy default, this is set to Internal for all presets. If you would like your \nsoftware to control the clock timing, make sure to set it to External . \n  \n \n \n16 \n  \nSetting Values Description \nGate 10\u201399% This determines the length of  each arpeggiator note, relative to the \nset Time Division and tempo. \nFreeze Off, On This turns Freeze mode on and off.  \nWhen on, the Arpeggiator will automatically enable Latch (if it is not \nalready enabled). Once the initial ar peggio is set, you can then freely \nplay other notes while the arpeggiation continues.  \nFrzCH# 2\u201316 This determines the MIDI Ch annel on which notes in Freeze mode \nare sent.  \nLatch Off, On This turns the latch feature on or off.  \nWhen on, the arpeggiator will continue even after you lift your \nfingers. While holding down the keys, you can add more notes to the arpeggiated chord by pressing down additional keys. If you press the \nkeys, release them, and then press down a new combination of notes, \nthe Arpeggiator will memorize and arpeggiate the new notes.  \nThis is the same as using the LATCH button on MPK\u00ae mini IV. \n \n \nIn addition to editing Arpeggiator settings using th e Configuration menu, you can also press and hold the ARP \nbutton and use the keyboard or Knobs to edit the noted parameters. \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n17 \n  \nPattern Mode  \n \nIn addition to standard arpeggiations, MPK\u00ae mini IV features a Pattern Editor to create and apply further variations \nto the arpeggiator, including accents, off steps, sustain,  and ratchet notes. You can create, save, and trigger up \nto 16 different arpeggiation patterns, giving you a wealth of options for dynamic sequences.  \nTo turn Pattern Mode on or off, hold the ARP button and then tap the key labled PATTERN (G#2). \n \nTo enter Pattern Editor, hold the ARP button and then tap the key labled EDIT (A2). Use the encoder  to browse \nand edit the settings below. Use these settings in conjunction with the Pads to edit pattern as described.  \n \n \n \nSetting Values Description \nPatt Off, On This turns Pattern mode on and off. This is the same as holding the ARP \nbutton and pressing the PATTERN key (G#2). \nView  This determines the current editing view for the pads. \n Acc In this mode, the pads add accents to notes and set Off steps.  \nTap the pad once to edit the step to add an accent (pad is lit yellow). \nTap the pad again to edit the step to an Off step (pad is unlit). \nTap the pad again to return to an unaccented On step (pad is lit red). \n Sust In this mode, tap a pad to edit the step to add sustain to the note (pad is \nlit blue). \nThe current Gate setting will be ignored for a Su stain note, and the note is \ninstead played with 110% Gate. This ca uses the note to ring out longer, \npotentially overlapping with the next  played note in the arp pattern. \n Ratch In this mode, tap a pad to edit the step to add a note ratchet  (pad is lit \ngreen). This will play two notes at two-times the current time division setting. For example, if the time divisi on is 1/8, then a ratchet step will \nplay two notes at 1/16. \nStyle  This determines how the arpeggiator will play when an Off step is \nencountered.  \n Skip In this mode, the next note in line is skipped when an Off step is \nencountered. This results in an arpeggio where notes consistently fall on \nthe same beats, even if Off steps are inserted.  \n Rest In this mode, the next note in line is held when an Off step is \nencountered until the next On step. This results in an arpeggio where notes do not always fall on the same beats when Off steps are inserted.  \n \n \n18 \n  \nSetting Values Description \nLength 8, 16 This determines the length of the pattern. Each step size is determined \nby the current arpeggio time division value.  \nAc Amt 10\u2013100 This determines the amount of velocity accent applied to notes \nPatt# 1\u201316 This is the current pattern being edited.   \nNote:  Navigating away from the current  pattern will discard all unsaved \nchanges. \nSave?

This allows you to create programs that can be customized to other software or external MIDI gear.  \nTo open Program Edit Mode, hold SHIFT and \npress the OCT - button. Use the encoder to \nbrowse and edit the settings below.   \n  \nSetting  Values Description \nPads MidiCh 1\u201316 This is the MIDI channel that the pads send data on. \n Note# 0\u2013127 This is the standard MIDI note number assigned to the pad when it \nis in Note mode.  \n PC# 0\u2013127 This is the Program Change value assigned to the pad when the \nPROG CHNG function is turned on. \n CC# 0\u2013127 This is the standard MIDI Control Change (CC) assigned to the \npad when the CC# function is turned on. \n Off C 0\u2013127 This adjusts the color of the pad when it is of f \n On C 0\u2013127 This adjusts the color of the pad when it is on. \n \nNote:  CC# and Program Change pad messages cannot be used with the DAW  or Plugin  presets as these \nare mapped to control different pad modes in the supported software. \n \n \nSetting  Values Description \nKnobs CC# 0\u2013127 This is the standard M IDI Control Change (CC) number assigned \nto the knob. \n LoVal 0\u2013127 This is the lowest value sent by the knob.   \n HiVal 0\u2013127 This is the highest value sent by the knob. \n Mode Abs, Rel This determines the behavior of the knob. \nWhen set to Abs (Absolute), the knob always sends a definitive \nvalue between the set LoVal  and HiVal , such as between 0 and \n127. With endless encoders, this can mean that in certain uses you may need to spin the encoder to \u201ccatch up\u201d to the current control value, such as when switching between banks of different controls.  \nWhen set to Rel (Relative), the knob sends general messages that \neither decrease or increase the current value for the assigned control depending on which way you turn the knob. The speed of \nthe value change is also relative to how fast you turn the knob. \n  \nTo save a custom program,  hold SHIFT and press the OCT + button. Use the encoder to select a User  preset \nslot, and then press it to confirm.  \nNote:  Program Edit/Save parameters are not available in DAW  and Plugin  presets, and you cannot save over \nDAW and Plugin presets to maintain script compatibility. Make sure you have loaded a User Preset to edit and \nsave Programs. \n \nTo load a custom program, hold SHIFT and press the PLUGIN/DAW / USER PRESETS button. Use the encoder \nto browse and select the desired preset from the list.  \n \n \n21 \n  \nGlobal Menu \n \nThe Global Menu is used to customize the hardware device settings of \nMPK\u00ae mini IV. \nTo open the Global Menu,  press and hold SHIFT and then press \nthe LOOP button. Use the encoder  to browse and edit the \nfollowing settings.  \nWhen you are finished editing, press the PLUGIN/DAW button to \nexit. \n \n \nSetting Values Description \nMidiCh 1\u201316 This is the MIDI channel that the \nkeys and knobs send data on. Note: These settings can only be changed \nfor User Presets. They cannot be changed \nwhile using the DAW  or Plugin  Presets to \nmaintain mapping compatibility. PadCh 1\u201316 This is the MIDI channel that the \npads send data on.   \nOct -4 \u2013 0 \u2013 4 This is the current octave setting for the keys. This is the same as using the \nOct -/+ buttons. \nKTrans -12 \u2013 0 \u2013 12 This is the transposition value of the keys. \nTempo 30\u2013240 This is the current BPM (beats per minute) of the internal tempo clock. \nTap 2\u20134 This is the number of taps required for the Tap Tempo button to set a new \ntempo.  \nAft Off, Chan, Poly This is the type of Aftert ouch message sent by applying pressure to the \npads after the initial Note On.  \nChan  (Channel Pressure) affects all notes played on the current channel. \nPoly (Poly Aftertouch) affects each note individually. \nToggle Off, On This switches the pad modes from momentary behavior to toggle. \nWhen on, hitting the pad triggers a Note On message (or CC value), and it \nmust be hit again to trigger a Note Off message (or CC 0 value). \nFullVel Off, On This setting turns Full Velocity mode on or off for the keys.  \nWhen on, all keys send full velocity (127) no matter how hard or soft you \nstrike them. \nTrnspt nOff, wOf f This determines the behavior of the Transport buttons ( Undo , Loop , \nStop/Play , Record , and Overdub ). \nWhen set to nOff , the Transport buttons send a Note On message only \neach time they are pressed. When set to wOff , the Transport buttons send \na Note On message when pressed and a Note Off message when released.  \nKbdCrv Light, Norm, \nHeavy This determines the playing response of the keys. \nLight:  For players with a lighter touch, notes will reach higher velocity with \nless force. \nHeavy:  For heavier-handed players, notes will require more force to hit \nhigher velocities.  \n \n  \n \n \n22 \n  \nSetting Values Description \nKnobM Abs, Rel This determines the default mo de for the knobs, affecting all eight at the \nsame time. \nWhen set to Abs (Absolute), the knob always sends a definitive value \nbetween the set LoVal  and HiVal , such as between 0 and 127. With \nendless encoders, this can mean that in certain uses you may need to spin \nthe encoder to \u201ccatch up\u201d to the current control value, such as when \nswitching between banks of different controls.   \nWhen set to Rel (Relative), the knob sends general messages that either \ndecrease or increase the current value for the assigned control depending on which way you turn the knob. The speed of the value change is also \nrelative to how fast you turn the knob. \nSust  Norm, Inv  Depending on the polarity of your sustain pedal, normally open or closed, \nyou can adjust this setting to ensure sustain messages are correctly \ntransmitted to MPK\u00ae mini IV. If you are having issues with a connected sustain pedal not working as intended, try changing to the opposite setting. \nDINsrc  USB, Int  This setting determines the source of data sent to the MIDI Out  port. Select \nUSB to send MIDI coming from the USB-C\u00ae port. Select INT to send \ninternal MIDI data from the MPK\u00ae mini IV hardware.  \n   \n \n \n23 \n  \nAppendix \n \nTechnical Specifications \n \nDisplay 0.96\u201d Color LCD \nNote Keys 25 velocity-sensitive keys; +/- 4 oc taves with octave up/down buttons \nPads 8 velocity- and pressure-sensitive  RGB back-lit pads  \nKnobs 8 assignable  360\u00b0 knobs \n1 push encoder \nWheels Pitch Bend Wheel \nModulation Wheel \nButtons 14  single-color LED buttons \n2 bi-color LED buttons \nConnectors 1  USB Type-C\u00ae Port \n1 MIDI DIN Out Port \n1 1/4\" [6.35 mm] Sustain Input \nPower via USB type-C (bus powered or connected to wall adapter [5V, 0.5A; sold separately) \nDimensions  \n(width x depth x height)  13.7\u201d x 7.6\u201d x 1.5\u201d \n34.7 x 19.2 x 3.7 cm \nWeight 2.2 lbs. \n1 kg \n \nSpecifications are subject to change without notice. \nModel: AD41 \n \n \nTrademarks & Licenses \n \nAkai Professional is a trademark of inMusic Brands, Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. \nAbleton is a trademark of Ableton AG. \nCubase is a registered trademark of Steinberg Media Technologies GmbH.

requirements, compatibility information, \netc.) and product registration, visit akaipro.com/mpkmini . \nFor additional product support, visit akaipro.com/support . \n  \nInstallation \n \nWindows\u00ae \n \n1. Double-click the .exe installer file you downloaded. \n2. Follow the on-screen instructions. \n \n \nMac\u00ae OS X\u00ae \n \n1. Double-click the .pkg installer file you downloaded. \n2. Follow the on-screen instructions. \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n  \nOperation \n \nGetting Started \n \nTo use the MPK mini Editor: \n1. Optional:  Connect MPK mini to your computer using a standard USB cable. (If you are \nconnecting MPK mini to a USB hub, make sure it is a powered hub.) You can still use the editor without connecting an MPK mini, but you will not be able to send Programs to it or \nload (get) Programs from it. \n2. Open the MPK mini Editor. The window will show a graphical representation of your MPK \nmini with all of its editable controls. See the following Graphical Interface  section for an \noverview of each section. \n \n \n 6  \n  \nGraphical Interface \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe MPK mini Editor has a straightforward graphical user interface that can be broken down \ninto the following sections: \n\u2022 Program Management:  These controls let you export (send) the currently loaded \nProgram to a connected MPK mini or import (get) a Program from a connected MPK mini \nand load it into the editor. See Managing Your Programs  to learn more about this as \nwell as saving and loading Programs to and from your computer. \n\u2022 Pads:  This is a visual representation of all eight pads in both banks (A and B). See \nEditing the Pads  to learn more. \n\u2022 Knobs:  This is a visual representation of all eight knobs. See Editing the Knobs to learn \nmore. Joystick Pads Knobs \nProgram \nManagement Channels Keyboard and Arpeggiator \n \n 7  \n  \n\u2022 Keyboard and Arpeggiator:  This is a visual representation of the 25-key keyboard as \nwell as the settings that control the timing, range, and overall behavior of the arpeggiator. \nSee Editing the Keyboard and Arpeggiator  to learn more. \n\u2022 Joystick:  These settings control the parameters affected by the X-Y Controller (Joystick). \nSee Editing the X-Y Controller (Joystick)  to learn more. \n\u2022 Channels: These two fields determine the channels over which the pads and the knobs, \nX-Y Controller (joystick), and keyboard send their messages. This information is covered \nin the chapter for each control: Editing the Pads , Editing the Knobs , Editing the X-Y  \nController (Joystick) , and Editing the Keyboard and Apeggiator > Keyboard . \n \n 8  \n  \nManaging Your Programs \n \nAbout Programs \n \nA Program  is a preset file ( .mk2 ) containing all of the MIDI assignments you make in the \nEditor. Using Programs lets you maintain several different control configurations to use in different situations. For instance, you may use different Programs with different kinds of \nsoftware, or you may some Programs for production and others for performance.  \nMPK mini can store a maximum of four Programs, and you can store additional Programs on \nyour computer to load onto MPK mini with this editor. \nThis chapter explains how to load Programs into the editor ( Loading Programs ), save \nPrograms onto your computer ( Saving Programs ), and send Programs to your connected \nMPK mini ( Sending Programs ). \n \n \nLoading Programs \n To edit a Program, you first have to load it into the MPK mini editor. \nTo load a Program from a connected MPK mini,  click the Get button \nfor the desired Program: Program 1 , 2, 3, or 4. (Editing this Program will \nnot affect the Program stored on your MPK mini. See Sending Programs  \nbelow to learn how to send the edited Program to MPK mini.)  \nTo load a Program from your computer,  go to File > Open , locate the \ndesired file (.mk2) , and click Open . \n You can also load a Program from MPK mini's RAM, where it is stored \ntemporarily, rather than from a stored Program. \nTo load a Program from the RAM of a connected MPK mini,  click the \nFile menu, select Get from Hardware , and select RAM . \n\n \n 9  \n  \nSaving Programs \n \nSaving a Program on your computer lets you edit it or send it to MPK mini in the future. All \nMIDI assignments that you see in the editor will be saved in the Program. \nTo save a Program,  go to File > Save , select the desired location, enter a file name, and click \nSave . The Program will be saved as a .mk2  file. \nTo save a Program under a different name or to a different location,  go to File > Save As , \nselect the desired location, enter a file name, and click Save . The Program will be saved as a \n.mk2  file. \n \n \nSending Programs \n Sending a Program to a connected MPK mini lets you transfer the \nProgram from the editor to the MPK mini's internal memory so you can \nselect it while using it. All MIDI assignments that you see in the editor will \nbe sent to the MPK mini. \nTo send a Program to a connected MPK mini,  click the Send  button for \nthe Program you want it to be on your MPK mini: Program 1 , 2, 3, or 4. \nThis will overwrite that Program currently stored on your MPK mini. \n You can also send a Program to MPK mini's RAM, where it is stored \ntemporarily instead of overwriting a Program. This lets you try out the \nProgram's assignments with out \"committing\" them to  particular Program. \nIf you decide that you like the results, you can save them to your \ncomputer (see Saving Programs  above) or send it to a specific Program \non the MPK mini. \nTo send a Program to the RAM of a connected MPK mini,  click the \nSend to RAM  button.  \n \n\n \n 10  \n  \nEditing the Pads \n \nYou can set various assignments for each  pad in either bank, including its \nMIDI note, CC message, Program Change message, and press behavior. You \ncan also set the MIDI channel over which all of the pads send their messages. \nTip: See Auto-Populating the Pads  to learn how to quickly apply common \n\"patterns\" of assignments to the pads, sparing you the time of having to \nselect each assignment manually. \n \nTo select the MIDI note a pad sends, do either of the following: \n\u2022 Click the first Note  field within a pad, and select th e desired MIDI note  value from the \npop-up menu ( C-1 \u2013 G9).  \n\u2022 Click the second Note  field within a pad, and type the desired MIDI note number ( 0 \u2013 \n127). The MIDI note value will change accordingly. \n \nTo select the CC message a pad sends, click the CC field within a pad, and type the desired \nCC number ( 0 \u2013 127).  \n \nTo select the Program Change message a pad sends, click the PC field within a pad, and \ntype the desired Program Change number ( 0 \u2013 127). \n \nTo select how the pad behaves when pressed, click the bottom-most fi eld within a pad, and \nselect one of the two options: \n\u2022 Toggle:  The pad \"latches\"; it sends its message co ntinuously when it is first pressed and \nstops sending it when it is pressed a second time. \n\u2022 Momentary:  The pad sends its message while being pressed and stops sending it when \nit is released. \n \nTo select the MIDI channel over which all of the pads send their \nmessages,  click the Pad MIDI Channel field at the bottom of the \nwindow, and type the desired MIDI channel number ( 1 \u2013 16). \n\n \n 11  \n  \nEditing the Knobs \n \nYou can set various assignments for each of the eight knobs, including its CC \nmessage and its minimum and maximum values. You can also set the MIDI \nchannel over which all of the knobs send their messages. \nTip: See Auto-Populating the Knobs  to learn how to qu ickly apply common \n\"patterns\" of assignments to the knobs, sp aring you the time of having to select \neach assignment manually. \n \nTo select the CC message a knob sends, click the CC field under a knob, and type the \ndesired CC number ( 0 \u2013 127).  \n \nTo select a knob's minimum and maximum values, click the Lo field (minimum) or Hi field \n(maximum) under a knob, and type the desired value ( 0 \u2013 127). \n \nTo select the MIDI channel over which all of the knobs \nsend their messages,  click the Keybed / Controls MIDI \nChannel field at the bottom of the window, and type the \ndesired MIDI channel number ( 1 \u2013 16). This affects the knobs, \nX-Y Contoller (joystick), and keyboard. \n\n \n 12  \n  \nEditing the X-Y Controller (Joystick) \n \nYou can set the assignment of each ax is of the X-Y Controller (joystick), \nletting you use it to manipulate two different parameters simultaneously. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nTo select what message an axis sends, click the X Axis  or Y Axis  field under the X-Y \nController, and select the desired message from the pop-up menu:  \n\u2022 Pitchbend:  Moving the X-Y controller along this axis will send pitchbend information. \n\u2022 CC 1:  Moving the X-Y controller along this axis will send one CC message. \n\u2022 CC 2:  Moving the X-Y controller along this axis will send one CC message in the positive \ndirection (up or right) and another CC message in the negative direction (down or left). \n \nTo select the CC message the X-Y Controller sends (when set to CC1 or CC2), click the \nfield(s) under the X Axis  or Y Axis  field, and type the desired value ( 0 \u2013 127). \n \nTo select the MIDI channel over which the X-Y Controller \nsends its messages,  click the Keybed / Controls MIDI \nChannel field at the bottom of the window, and type the \ndesired MIDI channel number ( 1 \u2013 16). This affects the knobs, \nX-Y Controller (joystick), and keyboard. \n\n \n 13  \n  \nEditing the Keyboard and Arpeggiator \n \nKeyboard \n \n \n \nYou can set the keyboard's octave and transposition. \n \nTo transpose the keyboard,  click the Transpose  field under the keyboard, and type the \ndesired value ( -12 to +12 semitones). A transposition of 0 means the keyboard is not \ntransposed. For reference, the leftmost key will display its note value to indicate the \ntransposition.  \n \nTo change the keyboard's octave,  click the Octave field under the keyboard, and type the \ndesired value ( -4 to +4 octaves) (this is the same as using your MPK mini's Octave  buttons). \nAn octave of 0 means the keyboard is at its center/default octave. For reference, the leftmost \nkey will display its note value to indicate the octave shift.  \n \nTo select the MIDI channel over which the keyboard  \nsends its messages,  click the Keybed / Controls MIDI \nChannel field at the bottom of the window, and type the \ndesired MIDI channel number ( 1 \u2013 16). This affects the knobs, \nX-Y Controller (joystick), and keyboard. \n\n \n 14  \n  \nArpeggiator \n \n \n \nYou can set various assignments for the arpeggiator. \n \nTo activate or deactivate the arpeggiator, click the On/Off  button (this is the same as \npressing the Arpeggiator On/Off  button on your MPK mini). \n \nTo set the arpeggiator's time division, click the Time Div  field, and select the desired setting \nfrom the pop-up menu:  1/4 note, 1/4 note triplet ( 1/4T ), 1/8 note, 1/8 note triplet ( 1/8T ), 1/16 \nnote, 1/16 note triplet ( 1/16T ), 1/32 note, or 1/32 note triplet ( 1/32T ).  \n \nTo set the arpeggiator's mode, click the Mode field, and select the desired setting from the \npop-up menu.  The mode determines how the arpeggiated notes are played back: \n\u2022 Up: Notes will sound from the lowest to the highest. \n\u2022 Down:  Notes will sound from the highest to lowest. \n\u2022 Inclusive:  Notes will sound from the lowest to the highest, and then back down. The \nlowest and highest notes will sound twice  at the directional change. \n\u2022 Exclusive:  Notes will sound from the lowest to the highest, and then back down. The \nlowest and highest notes will sound only once  at the directional change. \n\u2022 Order : Notes will sound in the order they were pressed. \n\u2022 Random:  Notes will sound in random order. \n \n 15  \n  \nTo activate or deactivate Latch, click the Latch field, and select Off or On. When Latch is \nOn, the Arpeggiator will continue to arpeggiate the notes even after you lift your fingers. While \nholding down the keys, you can add more notes to the arpeggia ted chord by pressing down \nadditional keys.

Using Program \nChange messages, MPK225 can tell another ha rdware or software device which sound \nto play. \nFor example, if your MPK225 is controlling a piano pat ch in your software or an external MIDI device, \nsending a Program Change message from MPK225  causes it to switch to a synth patch.  \n \nThe MPK225 lets you send two types of Program Change messages: \n\u2022 Program Change: This is a standard Program Change message (0-127) sent to your software \nor external device, letting you switch  between 128 differ ent program banks. \n\u2022 Program Change with Bank Change: This is a standard Progra m Change message (0-127) \nplus a Bank Select LSB (Least Significant Bit) (0-127) and a Bank Select  MSB  (Most Significant \nBit) message (0-127). This gives you access to up to 16384 different program banks. Your \nsoftware or external device must support LSB and MSB mess ages to use th is feature. \n \nTo navigate Program Change Mode: \n1. Press Program Change  to enter Program Change Mode. \n2. In each page of Program Change Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move throug h the parameters on the \ncurrent page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently  selected value/setting. \nImportant:  These changes cannot be sav ed to your Presets or global settings. Once you power \noff the MPK225 they will return  to the defau lt settings. \n \nFor an overview of the availabl e settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode Parameters  \nsection. \n \n 7  \n  \nFeatures \n \nTop Panel \n \n18\n1011\n15\n16 16 16 161711 11 11\n11 11 11 119\n3422\n51213\n181920 21 22 23\n2425 25 25 25 251412 12 12\n67\n \n \n1.

Um die neuen Einstellungen des Global-Modus zu speichern, verwenden Sie die linken  und rechten  \nCursor-Tasten, um die Seite Globale Einstellungen Speichern (Save Globals)  auszuw\u00e4hlen und \ndr\u00fccken Sie das Datenrad, um den Vorgang zu best\u00e4tigen. \nUm den Vorgang stattdessen abzubrechen, verwenden Sie die linken  oder rechten  Cursor-Tasten, \num eine andere Seite auszuw\u00e4hlen oder dr\u00fccken Sie Global .  \n \nUm die Werkseinstellungen des Global-Modus wiederherzustellen: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Preset , um den Preset-Modus aufzurufen. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie die linke Cursor-Taste , damit die Werkseinstellungen  am Display erscheinen. \n3. Drehen Sie das Datenrad  und w\u00e4hlen Sie Global . \n4. Um die Werkseinstellungen des MPK225 Global-Mod us wiederherzustellen (dabei werden die von \nIhnen gespeicherten Einstellungen \u00fcberschrieben), dr\u00fccken Sie das Datenrad . \nUm den Vorgang abzubrechen, dr\u00fccken Sie Preset . \n \nEine \u00dcbersicht der verf\u00fcgbaren Einstellungen und Parameter finden Sie im Anhang:  Modusparameter . \n \nProgrammwechselmodus \n \nEin Programmwechsel , oft als Patch-Wechsel  bezeichnet, ist eine MIDI-Nachricht, die von \neinem Ger\u00e4t zum anderen gesendet wird und bewirkt, dass das empfangende Ger\u00e4t zu einem \nneuen Programm wechselt. Mit Programmwechsel kann das MPK225 anderen Hardware- oder \nSoftware-Ger\u00e4ten mitteilen, welche Sounds abzuspielen sind. \nWenn Ihr MPK225 beispielsweise einen Klavier-Patch in Ihrer Software oder einem externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4t \nsteuert, kann das Senden einer Programmwechselnachricht vom MPK225 bewirken, dass zu einem Synthesizer-Patch gewechselt wird.  \n \nDas MPK225 kann zwei Arten von Programmwechselnachrichten senden: \n\u2022 Programmwechsel: Dies ist eine standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Programmwechselnachricht (0-127), die an Ihre \nSoftware oder Ihr externes Ger\u00e4t gesendet wird, damit Sie zwischen 128 verschiedenen \nProgrammbanken wechseln k\u00f6nnen. \n\u2022 Programmwechsel mit Bankwechsel: Dies ist eine standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Programmwechselnachricht (0-\n127) MIT einer Bankauswahlnachricht LSB  (Least Significant Bit - niedrigstwertiges Bit) (0-127) und \neiner Bankauswahlnachricht MSB  (Most Significant Bit - h\u00f6chstwertiges Byte) (0-127). Damit haben \nSie Zugriff auf bis zu 16384 verschiedene Programmbanken. Ihre Software oder externes Ger\u00e4t muss \nLSB- und MSB-Befehle unterst\u00fctzen, um diese Funktion zu nutzen. \n \nSo navigieren Sie im Programmwechselmodus: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Programmwechsel (Program Change) , um in den Programmwechselmodus zu \ngelangen. \n2. Auf jeder Seite des Programmwechselmodus: \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die Cursor-Tasten f\u00fcr aufw\u00e4rts  und abw\u00e4rts , um durch die Parameter auf der \naktuellen Seite zu bl\u00e4ttern. \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die linken  und rechten  Cursor-Tasten, um zwischen den verschiedenen Seiten \nzu wechseln. \n\u2022 Drehen Sie das Datenrad , um den/die aktuell ausgew\u00e4hlte/n Wert bzw. Einstellung zu \u00e4ndern. \nWichtig:  Diese Ver\u00e4nderungen k\u00f6nnen nicht mit Ihren Presets oder globalen Einstellungen \ngespeichert werden. Nach dem Ausschalten des MPK225 werden sie wieder auf die \nStandardeinstellungen zur\u00fcckgesetzt. \n \nEine \u00dcbersicht der verf\u00fcgbaren Einstellungen und Parameter finden Sie im Anhang:  Modusparameter . \n \n 35  \n  \nFunktionen \n \nOberseite \n \n18\n1011\n15\n16 16 16 161711 11 11\n11 11 11 119\n3422\n51213\n181920 21 22 23\n2425 25 25 25 251412 12 12\n67\n \n \n1.

Dies verhin dert das Senden von fehlerhaften Controller-\nMeldungen aufgrund der physikal ischen Position des Controlle rs. (Dies ist n\u00fctzlich, wenn \nzwischen Control-Banken gewechselt wird, bei  denen zum Beispiel di e physische Position \neines Regler nicht dem letzten von der Steu erung gesendeten We rt entspricht.)  \n \n 37  \n  \n24. Loop:  Halten Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt, um den  Loop oder die Repeat -Funktion in Ihrer \nSoftware zu aktivieren. Diese Taste wird als Transportsteueru ng betrachtet, damit sie die \ngleichen Nachrichten wie die anderen Transporttasten sen den kann: MMC (MIDI Machine \nControl), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/Stopp oder vorher zu gewiesenen MIDI-CC-Werte. \nWichtig:  Um diese Funktion nu tzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss Ihre Software eine Loop- oder Wiederhol-\nFunktion haben. Achten Sie a u\u00dferdem darauf, dass Sie das MPK225 Preset verwenden, das \nnach Ihrer jeweiligen Software benannt ist. We nn Ihre Software \u00fcber  kein entsprechendes \nMPK225 Preset verf\u00fcgt, konfigurieren Sie die Loop-Taste im Bearbeitungsmodus, damit sie \nordnungsgem\u00e4\u00df mit Ihrer Software kommuniziert.  \n25. Transporttasten: Diese f\u00fcnf speziellen Tasten senden ko nventionelle Transportsteuerbefehle. \nR\u00fccklauf , Vorspulen , Stopp , Wiedergabe  und Aufnahme . Diese Tasten k\u00f6nnen MMC (MIDI \nMachine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Star t/Stopp oder vorher zugewiesene MIDI-CC-\nWerte senden.  \n \nR\u00fcckseite \n \n1. Stromversorgung: Wenn Sie in Ihrem \nSetup keinen Computer verwenden \nm\u00f6chten (d.h., wenn Sie das MPK225 verwenden, um ein externes MIDI-Modul zu steuern), dann verbinden Sie das \nMPK225 mit einer Steckdose mit einem \noptionalen Adapter (6  V DC, 1A, mittlerer \nPin mit positiver Polarit\u00e4t, separat \nerh\u00e4ltlich). Alternativ k\u00f6nnen Sie den USB-Anschluss  des MPK225 \u00fcber ein Standard-USB-\nLadeger\u00e4t (separat erh\u00e4ltlich) mit einer Steckdose verbinden. \n2.

Netzschalter:  Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um das MPK225 ein- oder auszuschalten. \n4. Kensington Lock:  Sie k\u00f6nnen diesen Kensington Lock Sicherheits-Slot ve rwenden, um das \nMPK225 an einem Tisch oder einer anderen Oberfl\u00e4che zu befestigen. \n5. USB-Port: Verwenden Sie ein Standard-USB-Kabel, um diesen USB-Port mit Ihrem Computer \nzu verbinden. Der USB-Port des Computers versorgt das MPK225 mit ausreichend Strom. \nAlternativ k\u00f6nnen Sie das MPK225 auch mit Stro m versorgen, indem Sie diesen USB-Port \u00fcber \nein Standard-USB-Ladeger \u00e4t (separat erh\u00e4ltlich) mit ei ner Steckdose verbinden. Diese \nVerbindung wird auch verwendet , um MIDI-Daten vom und zum Computer zu senden und zu \nempfangen. \nDiese Verbindung ist auch f\u00fcr das MIDI Out  und MIDI In  des MPK225 relevant: \n\u2022 Wenn ein externes Ger\u00e4t mit dem MIDI Out  verbunden ist, kann Ihr Computer MIDI-\nMeldungen \u00fcber diesen Weg senden: Computer \uf0c6 MPK225 \uf0c6 Externes Ger\u00e4t . \n\u2022 Wenn ein externes Ger\u00e4t mit dem MIDI In  verbunden ist, sendet das externe Ger\u00e4t MIDI-\nNachrichten auf diesem Weg: Externes Ger\u00e4t \uf0c6 MPK225 \uf0c6 Computer . MIDI-Meldungen \nk\u00f6nnen dann \u00fcber das MIDI-Out an ein ex ternes Ger\u00e4t gesendet werden, diese \nMeldungen m\u00fcssen zun\u00e4chst jedoch den Computer passieren. \n6. MIDI Out: Verwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbli ches, f\u00fcnfpoliges MIDI-Kabel, um dies en Ausgang mit \ndem MIDI IN eines externen MI DI-Ger\u00e4ts zu verbinden (z.B. einem Synthesizer, Sequenzer, \nDrum-Computer etc.). \n7. MIDI In: Verwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbliches, f\u00fcnfp oliges MIDI-Kabel, um dieses MIDI In mit \ndem MIDI Out eines externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4ts zu verbinden (z.B. einem an deren MIDI-Controller). \nDie MIDI-Nachrichten, die an dies es MIDI In gesendet werden, werden \u00fcber den USB-Port an \nIhren Computer gesendet. \n8. Expression-Pedal-Eingang: Schlie\u00dfen Sie ein optionales 1/ 4\" TRS Expression-Pedal an \ndiesen Eingang an.  \n9. Sustain-Pedal-Eingang: Schlie\u00dfen Sie ein optionales 1/4\"  TS Sustain-Pedal oder einen \nFu\u00dfschalter an diesem Eingang an. (Sie k\u00f6nnen das angesc hlossene Pedal so  konfigurieren, \ndass es Sustain steuert, ei ne MIDI-CC-Nachricht oder andere Nachrichten sendet.) 12\n34 56789\n \n38 \n  \nAppendix (English) \n \nMode Parameters \n \nEdit Mode \n \nTo edit a control's parameters, press Edit then move or press that control.  \n \nControl Parameter Settings \nKeyboard MIDI Channel \nOctave Transpose MIDI to DIN Aftertouch Common, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n-4 to +4 -36 to +36 On, Off On, Off  \nAssignable \nPads Type \nMIDI Channel Note Aftertouch (Aft) MIDI to DIN \nOn Color \n \n  \nOff Color \n \n \nNote Mode Note \nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 C-1 to G9 Off, Channel Afterto uch (Ch), Poly Aftertouch (Poly) \nOn, Off \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light \nBlue, Blue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, \nLight Pink, Grey \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light \nBlue, Blue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nMomentary, Toggle \nType MIDI Channel Program Number MIDI to DIN \nOn Color \n \n \nOff Color Program Change \nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 \nOn, Off \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light \nBlue, Blue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, \nLight Pink, Grey \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light \nBlue, Blue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nType \nMIDI Channel Program (Pgm) MSB LSB \nMIDI to DIN \nOn Color \n \n  \nOff Color Program Bank \nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 000\u2013127 On, Off \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light \nBlue, Blue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, \nLight Pink, Grey \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light \nBlue, Blue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, \nLight Pink, Grey \n \n 39  \n  \nControl Parameter Settings \nAssignable \nKnobs  Type \nMIDI Channel CC Number \nMIDI to DIN \nMin Max MIDI CC\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 On, Off 000\u2013127 000\u2013127\nType MIDI Channel Min Max MIDI to DIN Aftertouch\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 On, Off \nType MIDI Channel MSB LSB MIDI to DIN Value Inc/Dec1\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 On, Off 000\u2013127 \nType MIDI Channel \nCC Number \nMIDI to DIN Inc/Dec2\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 On, Off \nAssignable \nSwitches Type \nMIDI Channel CC Number MIDI to DIN  Mode Invert CC\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 On, Off Momentary, Toggle On, Off  \nType MIDI Channel Note Velocity (Velo) MIDI to DIN  Mode Note\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \nC-1 to G9 000\u2013127 On, Off Momentary, Toggle \nType MIDI Channel \nProgram Number \nMIDI to DIN Program Change (PrgChange)\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 On, Off \nType MIDI Channel Program (Pgm) MSB LSB MIDI to DIN Program Bank (PrgBank)\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 000\u2013127 On, Off \nType Key 1 \n  \nKey 2 Keystroke\n0\u20139, A\u2013Z, F1\u2013F12, Backspace, Return , Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Left \nArrow, Right Arrow, Tab, various symbols ( , . / [ ] \\ ' ;

These settings are not specific to a Preset; they affect all \nPresets.  \n \nTo navigate Global Mode: \n1. Press Global  to enter Global Mode. \n2. In each page of Global Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move through the parameters on \nthe current page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. \n3. To save the new Global Mode settings, use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to \nselect the Save Globals  page, and press the Value Dial to confirm the operation. \nTo cancel the operation instead, use the Left Cursor  or Right Cursor  buttons to select \nanother page, or press Global .  \n \nTo restore the factory default Global Mode settings: \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Press the Left Cursor  button so Factory Settings appears in the display. \n3. Turn the Value Dial  and select Globals . \n4. To restore MPK225's factory defa ult Global Mode settings (w hich overwrites those you \nhave saved), press the Value Dial . \nTo cancel the operation, press Preset . \n \nEach section of this chapter is dedicated to a specific Global Mode setting and lists its \neditable parameters. \nFor an overview of the available settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode \nParameters  section. \n \n 23  \n  \nMIDI Channels \n \nCommon Channel (Common Chnl):  This setting determines which MIDI channel is the \ncommon channel (various controls can be assigned to the common channel in Edit Mode). The \navailable settings are USB A1 \u2013A16, and USB B1 \u2013B16. \n \n \nNote Display \n \nType:  Determines whether the display will show a note by its pitch Value  (e.g., C2, F#3, etc.) \nor by its MIDI note Number  (e.g., 36, 54, etc.). \n \n \nKeyboard \n \nImportant:  Edit Mode contains other parameters that affect the keyboard but are saved only \nwith the Preset, not with th e global settings. See the Edit Mode: Keyboard  section for more \ninformation. \n \nCurve:  The keyboard's velocity curve. The available range is -50 to +50. At a low value, the \ncurve is flatter at low velocities, becoming much steeper at high velocities. At a high value, the \ncurve is steeper at low velocities, becoming flatter at high velocities. At the maximum setting \nof +50, it takes very little force to generate a velocity value of 127. \n \nGain:  An offset to keyboard's overall velocity sensitivity. The available range is -20 to +20. At a \nlow value, more force is required to generate a note. At a high value, less force is required to generate a note. \n \nBlack / White:  An offset to the black keys' or white keys' overall velocity sensitivity. The \navailable range is -20 to +20. At a low value, more force is required to generate a note. At a \nhigh value, less force is required to generate a note. \nTip: These parameters are useful if you play the black keys and white keys differently (e.g., \ndue to the higher position of the black keys, your preferred hand positioning, etc.).  \n \n 24  \n  \nPads \n \nImportant:  Edit Mode contains other parameters that affect the pads but are saved only with \nthe Preset, not with the global settings. See the Edit Mode: Pads  section for more \ninformation. \n \nPad Threshold:  The velocity threshold to trigger the pads. The available range is 0\u201315. This \ncan help prevent false triggering or make it easier to trigger the pads.   \nVelocity Curve:  The pads' velocity curve. The available settings are Linear , Exp1 , Exp2 , \nLog1 , and Log2 . \n \nVelocity Sensitivity (VelocitySense):  The pads' overall velocity sensitivity. The available range \nis 01\u201310. At a low value, it would take a lot of for ce to generate a velocity value of 127. At a \nhigh value, the opposite is true. \n \n \nTempo \n \nImportant:  Edit Mode contains other parameters that affect the tempo but are saved only with \nthe Preset, not with the global settings. See the Edit Mode: Tap Tempo  section for more \ninformation. \n \nTempo: The global tempo as in dicated in beats per minute. When MPK225 is using its internal \nMIDI clock, this global tempo setting determines the speed of  the Arpeggiator, Sequencer, \nand Note Repeat rate. The available range is 30\u2013300 BPM.  \n \nTap Average : The number of times you would need to press the Tap Tempo  button to enter a \nnew tempo. The available range is 2\u20134. \n \nTempo LED:  When MPK225 is using its internal MIDI clock, the Tap Tempo  button LED will \nflash in time with the current temp o setting. You can set this feature On or Off. \n \n \n 25  \n  \nClock \n \nSource:  Determines whether MPK225 uses its Internal  MIDI clock or refers to an External  \nclock (e.g., from a DAW).  \n \nSysEx \n \nSend Program:  The Program to be sent via SysEx. The available options are the individual \nProgram numbers ( 01\u201330) or All Programs. Press the Value Dial  to send the Program.  \nProg: ___ Sent  will appear to confirm the Program was sent successfully. \n \n \nUtilities \n \nContrast:  The display's contrast. The available range is 0 to 99. \n \n \nSave Globals \n \nOn this page, press the Value Dial  to save your global settings. After Stored  flashes three \ntimes on the display, the gl obal settings are stored in  MPK225's internal memory. \n \n \nOS \n \nThis page displays MPK225's curren t operating system information. \n \n 26  \n  \nProgram Change Mode \n \nA Program Change , often referred to as a Patch Change , is a MIDI message \nfrom one device to another that causes the latter to switch to a new program. \nUsing Program Change messages, MP K225 can tell another hardware or \nsoftware device which sound to play . For example, if your MPK225 is \ncontrolling a piano patch in your software or an external MIDI device, sending a \nProgram Change message from  MPK225 causes it to switch to a synth patch.  \n \nMPK225 lets you send two types of Program Change messages: \n\u2022 Program Change: This is a standard Program Change  message (0\u2013127) sent to your \nsoftware or external  device, letting you switch betw een 128 different program banks. \n\u2022 Program Change with Bank Change: This is a standard Program Change message (0\u2013\n127) plus a Bank Select LSB (Least Significant Bit) (0\u2013127) and a Bank Select  MSB  (Most \nSignificant Bit) me ssage (0\u2013127). This give s you access to up to  16384 differ ent program \nbanks. Your software or external device must support LSB and MSB messages to use \nthis feature. \n \nTo navigate Program Change Mode: \n1. Press Program Change  to enter Program Change Mode. \n2. In each page of Program Change Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move through the parameters on \nthe current page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. \nImportant:  These changes cannot be saved to your Presets or global settings. Once you \npower off the MPK225 they will re turn to the default settings. \n \nEach section of this chapter is dedicated to a specific Program Change and lists its editable \nparameters. \nFor an overview of the available settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode \nParameters  section. \n \n 27  \n  \nProgram Change \n \nMIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent. The \navailable settings are Common , USB  A1\u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n \nProgram Number:  This determines the Program number that will be sent. The available range \nis 000\u2013127. Please refer to your external MIDI device's documentation for information on its \navailable programs. \n \nMIDI to DIN:  Determines whether or not MIDI data is sent to the MIDI Out ( On) or not ( Off). \nMIDI data will be sent to MPK225's USB conn ection regardless of this setting. Since an \nexternal device will usually be connected to MPK225's MIDI Out, we recommend leaving this \nset to On. \n \n \nProgram Change with Bank Change \n \nMIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent. The \navailable settings are Common , USB  A1\u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n \nProgram Number:  This determines the Program number that will be sent. The available range \nis 000\u2013127. Please refer to your external MIDI device's documentation for information on its \navailable programs. \n \nMSB / LSB:  These determine the MSB (Most Significan t Bit) and LSB (Least  Significant Bit). \nThe available range is 000\u2013127. \n \nMIDI to DIN:  Determines whether or not MIDI data is sent to the MIDI Out ( On) or not ( Off). \nMIDI data will be sent to MPK225's USB conn ection regardless of this setting.

To edit more controls, repeat Steps 2-3. \nTo return to a normal performance mode, press Preset . \nImportant:  Save the Preset to retain your edits. Without saving, these changes will be lost if \nyou load a new Preset. See the Preset Mode  section to learn how save your Preset. \n \nFor an overview of the available controls and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode \nParameters  section. \n \n \nAbout HID \nThe HID (Human Interface Device) protocol lets devices send typical computer keyboard \nkeystrokes. USB game controllers are an example of this, acting as an alternative to your \ncomputer's keyboard. MPK249 can also use the HID protocol, letting you configure certain \nbuttons to send your most-often used keystrokes to your software, so you no longer need to \nswitch focus constantly between the co mputer's keyboard and your MPK249. \n \nTo configure a control to use the HID protocol: \n1. Press Edit to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Select one of the Assignable Switches  or DAW Control Buttons  by pressing it. The \nselected button and its editable parameters will appear in the display. \n3. Turn the Value Dial  to change the Type  field to HID. \n4. Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to select the Key#1  field, and turn the \nValue Dial  to change it to the desired keystroke.  \n5. If your desired keystroke requires one or more modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Command, etc.), \nrepeat Step 4 for Key#2 , which lets you select different combinations of 1-3 modifier \nkeys.  \nImportant:  Save the Preset to retain your edits. Without saving, these changes will be lost if \nyou load a new Preset. See the Preset Mode  section to learn how save your Preset. \n \n \n6 \n  \nGlobal Mode \n  \nGlobal Mode lets you set parameters and make  changes to MPK249's general (\"global\") \nfunctioning. These settings are not specific to a Preset; th ey affect all Presets.  \n \n \nTo navigate Global Mode: \n1. Press Global  to enter Global Mode. \n2. In each page of Global Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move throug h the parameters on the \ncurrent page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently  selected value/setting. \n3. To save the new Global Mode settings, use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to \nselect the Save Globals  page, and press the Value Di al to confirm the operation. \nTo cancel the operation instead, use the Left Cursor  or Right Cursor  buttons to select another \npage, or press Global .  \n \nTo restore the factory default Global Mode settings: \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Press the Left Cursor  button so Factory Defaults  appears in the display. \n3. Turn the Value Dial  and select Globals . \n4. To restore MPK249's factor y default Global Mode settings (whi ch overwrites those you have \nsaved), press the Value Dial . \nTo cancel the operation, press Preset . \n \nFor an overview of the availabl e settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode Parameters  \nsection. \n \nProgram Change Mode \n \nA Program Change , often referred to as a Patch Change , is a MIDI message from one \ndevice to another that causes the latter to switch to a new program. Using Program \nChange messages, MPK249 can tell another ha rdware or software device which sound \nto play. \nFor example, if your MPK249 is controlling a piano pat ch in your software or an external MIDI device, \nsending a Program Change message from MPK249  causes it to switch to a synth patch.  \n \nThe MPK249 lets you send two types of Program Change messages: \n\u2022 Program Change: This is a standard Program Change message (0-127) sent to your software \nor external device, letting you switch  between 128 differ ent program banks. \n\u2022 Program Change with Bank Change: This is a standard Progra m Change message (0-127) \nplus a Bank Select LSB (Least Significant Bit) (0-127) and a Bank Select  MSB  (Most Significant \nBit) message (0-127). This gives you access to up to 16384 different program banks. Your \nsoftware or external device must support LSB and MSB mess ages to use th is feature. \n \nTo navigate Program Change Mode: \n1. Press Program Change  to enter Program Change Mode. \n2. In each page of Program Change Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move throug h the parameters on the \ncurrent page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently  selected value/setting. \nImportant:  These changes cannot be sav ed to your Presets or global settings. Once you power \noff the MPK249 they will return  to the defau lt settings. \n \nFor an overview of the availabl e settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode Parameters  \nsection. \n \n 7  \n  \nFeatures \n \nTop Panel \n \n134\n5\n76289\n1011 11 11 11 11 11 11 11\n13 13 13 13 13 13 13 1312 12 12 12 12 12 12 12\n14 15 151522 23 24 25 26 27\n28 28 28 28 2816 18\n19\n2021 17\n17\n17\n172\n \n \n1. Keyboard:  This 49-note keyboard is velocity-sen sitive and, in conjunction with the \nOctave Up/Down  buttons, can control a ten-octave range. \n2. Octave Up/Down: Use these buttons to shift the ke yboard's range up or down. The \ndisplay will indicate the current octave. Press both buttons simultaneously to reset the octave shift to \"zero.\" \n3. Pitch-Bend Wheel: Moving this wheel sends MIDI Pitch Bend information on a selected \nMIDI channel and port. \n4. Modulation Wheel: Moving this wheel sends conti nuous controller data\u2014MIDI CC #01 \n(modulation), by default. \n5. Tap Tempo: Tap this button at the desired rate to enter a new tempo. \nNote:  If you reload the current Preset, the tempo will revert to that Preset's tempo, which \nyou set in Edit Mode. \nImportant:  This feature does not work when the MPK249 is set to External  sync. \n6. Arp On/Off: Press this button to enable or disable the internal Arpeggiator whose rate is \nbased on the current Tempo and Time Division settings. The Arpeggiator will function on \nnotes being played on the keyboard only. \nNote:  You can also sync the Arpeggiator to an internal or external MIDI Clock source. \n7. Latch:  Press this button to acti vate or deactivate the Arpeggiator's Latch feature. When \nthe Arpeggiator is on and Latch is enabled, you can press a combination of keys on the \nkeyboard and the Arpeggiator continue to arpeggiate these notes even after you release \nthe keys. Pressing a new combination of keys will start a new arpeggiation. \nTip: While holding down a combination of keys on the keyboard, add more notes to that \narpeggiated chord by pre ssing additional keys.  \n8. Display: Use this LCD screen to view MPK249 's menus, options, parameters, and \nsettings. \n9. Value Dial (Push to Enter):  Use this dial to change the Preset, parameter values, \nsettings, etc. Pressing the dial also functions as an Enter  button. \n10. Cursor Buttons: Use these buttons to navigate through the menus and options in the \ndisplay. Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  to move through the parameters currently \nshown in the display. (On some pages, the display's last row contains multiple \nparameters. Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  to move between these, as well.) Use \nthe Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  to move to the prev ious or next page. \n11. Assignable Knobs: Use these 360\u00ba knobs to send co ntinuous controller messages to \nyour software or external MIDI device. \n \n8 \n  \n12. Assignable Faders: Use these faders to send continuo us controller messages to your \nsoftware or external MIDI device. \n13. Assignable Switches: Use these switches to send MIDI CC messages or Program \nChange messages to your software or external MIDI device. They can function as \nmomentary or toggle (latching) switches. If Time Division  is activated, these switches \nselect the time division of the Arpeggiator and Note Repeat features. \n14. Time Division: Press this button and then press one of the Assignable Switches  to \nselect the current Time Division, which determines the rate of the Note Repeat and \nArpeggiator features. This button can function as a momentary or toggle (latching) button.  \nImportant:  While Time Division  is active, the Assignable Switches  will not send any of \ntheir normal MIDI CC or Program Change messages until Time Division has been \ndeactivated. \n15. Control Bank Buttons: Use these buttons to select one of three independent banks of \ncontinuous controllers. This le ts you control up to 72 inde pendent parameters with the \nknobs, faders, and switches. \n16. Pads: Use these pads to trigger drum  hits or other samples in your software or external \nMIDI sound module. The pads are pressure- and velocity-sensitive, which makes them \nvery responsive and intuitive to play. \n17. Pad Bank: Use these buttons to select one of four independent banks of pads.

Auch das \nMPK249 kann das HID-Protokoll verwenden, dami t Sie bestimmte Tasten Ihrer am h\u00e4ufigsten \nverwendeten Tastenbefehle so ko nfigurieren k\u00f6nnen, dass sie an Ihre Software gesendet \nwerden und Sie nicht st\u00e4ndig zwischen Comput ertastatur und MPK249 hin- und herwechseln \nm\u00fcssen. \n \nSo konfigurieren Sie ein Steuerelement f\u00fcr das HID-Protokoll: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Bearbeiten (Edit) , um in den Bearbeitungsmodus zu gelangen. \n2. W\u00e4hlen Sie einen der zuweisbaren Schaltern  oder eine der DAW-Steuertasten , indem \nSie sie bet\u00e4tigen. Das ausgew\u00e4hlte Steuerelement und seine editierbaren Parameter \nwerden am Display angezeigt. \n3. Drehen Sie das Datenrad , um das Typenfeld (Type)  auf HID zu \u00e4ndern. \n4. Verwenden Sie die Cursortasten f\u00fcr Aufw\u00e4rts  und Abw\u00e4rts , um das Feld Taste#1 \n(Key#1)  auszuw\u00e4hlen und drehen Sie das Datenrad , um den gew\u00fcnschten \nTastenanschlag zu \u00e4ndern.  \n5. Wenn Ihr gew\u00fcnschter Tastenanschlag ein oder mehrere Zusatztasten erfordert (z.B. \nUmschalten, Command etc.), wiederholen Sie Schritt 4 f\u00fcr Taste#2 (Key#2)  mit der Sie \nverschiedene Kombinationen von 1-3 Zusatztasten ausw\u00e4hlen k\u00f6nnen.  \nWichtig:  Speichern Sie das Preset, um die \u00c4nderungen zu behalten. Wenn Sie das Preset \nnicht speichern, gehen Ihre \u00c4nderungen verloren, sobald Sie ein neues Preset laden. Siehe \nAbschnitt Preset-Modus , um zu erfahren, wie Sie Ihr Preset speichern. \n \n34 \n  \nGlobal-Modus \n  \nIm Global-Modus k\u00f6nnen Sie Parameter einste llen und \u00c4nderungen an den allgemeinen \n(\"globalen\") Funktionen des MPK249 vornehmen. Diese Einstellungen sind nicht Preset-spezifisch, sie betreffen alle Presets.  \n \nSo navigieren Sie im Global-Modus: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Global , um den Global-Modus aufzurufen. \n2. Auf jeder Seite des Global-Modus: \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die Cursor-Tasten f\u00fcr aufw\u00e4rts  und abw\u00e4rts , um durch die Parameter auf der \naktuellen Seite zu bl\u00e4ttern. \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die linken  und rechten  Cursor-Tasten, um zwischen den verschiedenen Seiten \nzu wechseln. \n\u2022 Drehen Sie das Datenrad , um den/die aktuell ausgew\u00e4hlte/n Wert bzw. Einstellung zu \u00e4ndern. \n3. Um die neuen Einstellungen des Global-Modus zu speichern, verwenden Sie die linken  und rechten  \nCursor-Tasten, um die Seite Globale Einstellungen Speichern (Save Globals)  auszuw\u00e4hlen und \ndr\u00fccken Sie das Datenrad, um den Vorgang zu best\u00e4tigen. \nUm den Vorgang stattdessen abzubrechen, verwenden Sie die linken  oder rechten  Cursor-Tasten, \num eine andere Seite auszuw\u00e4hlen oder dr\u00fccken Sie Global .  \n \nUm die Werkseinstellungen des Global-Modus wiederherzustellen: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Preset , um den Preset-Modus aufzurufen. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie die linke Cursor-Taste , damit die Werkseinstellungen  am Display erscheinen. \n3. Drehen Sie das Datenrad  und w\u00e4hlen Sie Global . \n4. Um die Werkseinstellungen des MPK249 Global-Mod us wiederherzustellen (dabei werden die von \nIhnen gespeicherten Einstellungen \u00fcberschrieben), dr\u00fccken Sie das Datenrad . \nUm den Vorgang abzubrechen, dr\u00fccken Sie Preset . \n \nEine \u00dcbersicht der verf\u00fcgbaren Einstellungen und Parameter finden Sie im Anhang:  Modusparameter . \n \nProgrammwechselmodus \n \nEin Programmwechsel , oft als Patch-Wechsel  bezeichnet, ist eine MIDI-Nachricht, die von \neinem Ger\u00e4t zum anderen gesendet wird und bewirkt, dass das empfangende Ger\u00e4t zu einem \nneuen Programm wechselt. Mit Programmwechsel kann das MPK249 anderen Hardware- oder \nSoftware-Ger\u00e4ten mitteilen, welche Sounds abzuspielen sind. \nWenn Ihr MPK249 beispielsweise einen Klavier-Patch in Ihrer Software oder einem externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4t \nsteuert, kann das Senden einer Programmwechselnachricht vom MPK249 bewirken, dass zu einem Synthesizer-Patch gewechselt wird.  \n \nDas MPK249 kann zwei Arten von Programmwechselnachrichten senden: \n\u2022 Programmwechsel: Dies ist eine standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Programmwechselnachricht (0-127), die an Ihre \nSoftware oder Ihr externes Ger\u00e4t gesendet wird, damit Sie zwischen 128 verschiedenen \nProgrammbanken wechseln k\u00f6nnen. \n\u2022 Programmwechsel mit Bankwechsel: Dies ist eine standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Programmwechselnachricht (0-\n127) MIT einer Bankauswahlnachricht LSB  (Least Significant Bit - niedrigstwertiges Bit) (0-127) und \neiner Bankauswahlnachricht MSB  (Most Significant Bit - h\u00f6chstwertiges Byte) (0-127). Damit haben \nSie Zugriff auf bis zu 16384 verschiedene Programmbanken. Ihre Software oder externes Ger\u00e4t muss \nLSB- und MSB-Befehle unterst\u00fctzen, um diese Funktion zu nutzen. \n \nSo navigieren Sie im Programmwechselmodus: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Programmwechsel (Program Change) , um in den Programmwechselmodus zu \ngelangen. \n2. Auf jeder Seite des Programmwechselmodus: \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die Cursor-Tasten f\u00fcr aufw\u00e4rts  und abw\u00e4rts , um durch die Parameter auf der \naktuellen Seite zu bl\u00e4ttern. \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die linken  und rechten  Cursor-Tasten, um zwischen den verschiedenen Seiten \nzu wechseln. \n\u2022 Drehen Sie das Datenrad , um den/die aktuell ausgew\u00e4hlte/n Wert bzw. Einstellung zu \u00e4ndern. \nWichtig:  Diese Ver\u00e4nderungen k\u00f6nnen nicht mit Ihren Presets oder globalen Einstellungen \ngespeichert werden. Nach dem Ausschalten des MPK249 werden sie wieder auf die \nStandardeinstellungen zur\u00fcckgesetzt. \n \nEine \u00dcbersicht der verf\u00fcgbaren Einstellungen und Parameter finden Sie im Anhang:  Modusparameter . \n \n 35  \n  \nFunktionen \n \nOberseite \n \n134\n5\n76289\n1011 11 11 11 11 11 11 11\n13 13 13 13 13 13 13 1312 12 12 12 12 12 12 12\n14 15 151522 23 24 25 26 27\n28 28 28 28 2816 18\n19\n2021 17\n17\n17\n172\n \n \n1. Keyboard:  Das 49-Tasten-Keyboard ist ansc hlagdynamisch und kann mit den Oktaventasten auf/ab \n(Octave Up/Down)  zehn Oktaven ansteuern. \n2. Oktave Auf/Ab: Mit diesen Tasten k\u00f6nnen Sie den Tastaturbereich nach oben oder unten \nverschieben. Das Display zeigt die aktuelle Oktave an. Dr\u00fccken Sie beide Tasten gleichzeitig, um die \nOktavenverschiebung auf \"Null\" zur\u00fcckzusetzen.  \n3. Pitch-Bend-Rad: Wenn dieses Rad bewegt wird, werden MIDI-Pitch-Bend-Informationen an einen \nausgew\u00e4hlten MIDI-Kanal und Port gesendet.  \n4. Modulationsrad: Wenn dieses Rad bewegt wird, werden stan dardm\u00e4\u00dfig Continuous Controller Daten \n- MIDI CC #01 (Modulation) gesendet. \n5. Tap-Tempo: Tippen Sie mit der gew\u00fcnschten Geschwindigkeit auf diese Schaltfl\u00e4che, um ein neues \nTempo einzugeben. \nHinweis:  Wenn Sie das aktuelle Preset erneut laden, wird das Tempo auf das Preset-Tempo \nzur\u00fcckgesetzt, das Sie im Bearbeitungsmodus eingestellt haben. \nWichtig:  Diese Funktion ist nicht durchf\u00fchrbar, wenn das MPK249 auf Externe  Sync eingestellt ist. \n6. Arp Ein/Aus: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um den internen Arpeggiator zu aktivieren oder zu \ndeaktivieren. Seine Rate beruht auf den aktuelle n Einstellungen von Tempo und Zeiteinteilung. Der \nArpeggiator funktioniert nur bei Noten, die am Keyboard gespielt werden. \nHinweis:  Sie k\u00f6nnen den Arpeggiator auch mit einer internen oder externen MIDI-Clock-Quelle \nsynchronisieren. \n7. Einrasten:  Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um die Einrast-Funktion des Arpeggiators zu aktivieren oder zu \ndeaktivieren. Wenn der Arpeggiator eingeschaltet ist und die Einrast-Funktion aktiviert ist, k\u00f6nnen Sie \neine Tastenkombination am Keyboard dr\u00fccken und der Arpeggiator wird diese Noten weiterhin als Arpeggio abspielen - auch wenn Sie die Tasten loslassen. Wenn Sie eine neue Tastenkombination bet\u00e4tigen, beginnt die entsprechende  Wiedergabe des neuen Arpeggio. \nTipp:  W\u00e4hrend Sie eine Tastenkombination am Keyboard gedr\u00fcckt halten, k\u00f6nnen Sie diesem \nArpeggio-Akkord weitere Noten hinzuf\u00fcgen, indem Sie zus\u00e4tzliche Tasten dr\u00fccken.  \n8. Anzeige: Auf diesem LCD-Bildschirm werden die Men\u00fcs , Optionen, Parameter und Einstellungen des \nMPK249 angezeigt. \n9. Datenrad (Push-to-Enter):  Mit diesem Rad k\u00f6nnen Sie Presets, Parameterwerte, Einstellungen usw. \n\u00e4ndern Dr\u00fccken des Rads fungiert auch als Eingabetaste . \n10. Cursor-Tasten: Verwenden Sie diese Tasten, um durch die Men\u00fcs und Optionen in der Anzeige zu \nnavigieren. Verwenden Sie die Cursor-Tasten aufw\u00e4rts  und abw\u00e4rts , um durch die aktuell im Display \nangezeigten Parameter zu navigieren. (Auf einigen Se iten sind in der letzten Display-Zeile mehrerer \nParameter angegeben. Verwenden Sie auch hier den Aufw\u00e4rts-  und Abw\u00e4rts-Cursor , um zwischen \ndiesen zu wechseln.) Verwenden Sie den Linken  und Rechten  Cursor, um zur vorherigen oder \nn\u00e4chsten Seite zu navigieren. \n \n36 \n  \n11. Zuweisbare Drehregler: Benutzen Sie diese 360\u00ba Drehregler, um Continuous Controller Nachrichten \nan Ihre Software oder externe MIDI-Ger\u00e4te zu senden. \n12. Zuweisbare Fader: Mit diesen Fadern k\u00f6nnen Sie Continuous Controller-Nachrichten an Ihre \nSoftware oder externen  MIDI-Ger\u00e4te senden. \n13. Zuweisbare Schalter: Verwenden Sie diese Schalter, um MIDI CC-Nachrichten oder \nProgrammwechselmeldungen an Ihre Software oder Ihr externes MIDI-Ger\u00e4t zu senden. Sie k\u00f6nnen \nals tempor\u00e4re oder einrastende Schalter funktionieren. Wenn die Zeiteinteilung  aktiviert ist, w\u00e4hlen \nSie mit diesen Schaltern die Zeiteinteilung des Arpeggiators und der Funktion Note Wiederholen aus. \n14. Zeiteinteilung: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste und dr\u00fccken Sie dann eine der zuweisbaren Schalter , um \ndie aktuelle Zeiteinteilung auszuw\u00e4hlen, die die Geschwindigkeit der Funktionen Note Wiederholen \nund Arpeggio bestimmt. Diese Taste kann als tempor\u00e4re oder einrastende Taste funktionieren.  \nWichtig:  W\u00e4hrend die Zeiteinteilung  aktiv ist, werden die zuweisbaren Schalter  solange keine ihrer \nnormalen MIDI CC- oder Programmwechselnachrichten senden bis die Zeiteinteilung deaktiviert \nwurde. \n15. Control-Bank-Tasten:  Verwenden Sie diese Tasten, um eine von drei unabh\u00e4ngigen Continuous \nController Banken auszuw\u00e4hlen. Mit diesen Tasten k\u00f6nnen Sie mit den Reglern, Fadern und Schaltern \nbis zu 72 unabh\u00e4ngige Parameter steuern. \n16. Pads: Verwenden Sie diese Pads, um Drum-Hits oder andere Samples in Ihrer Software oder Ihrem \nexternen MIDI-Soundmodul anzusteuern. Die Pads  sind anschlagdynamisch und druckempfindlich, \nwas sie besonders reaktionsf\u00e4hig und intuitiv spielbar macht. \n17. Pad-Bank: Verwenden Sie diese Tasten, um eine von vier unabh\u00e4ngigen Pad-Banken auszuw\u00e4hlen. \nJede Pad-Bank kann ein einzigartiges Sample-Set enthalten, so dass Sie Zugriff auf bis zu 48 \nverschiedene Sounds erhalten. \n18. Full Level: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um den Full Level-Mo dus zu aktivieren, in  dem die Pads immer \nmit der maximalen Anschlagst\u00e4rke (127) abgespielt  werden, egal wie stark oder schwach die Pads \nbet\u00e4tigt werden. \n19. 16 Level: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Schaltfl\u00e4che, um den 16 Level-Modus zu aktivieren, in dem das zuletzt \nausgel\u00f6ste Pad allen 16 Pads zugeordnet wird. Alle 16 Pads geben nun die gleiche Notennummer wie \ndas zuletzt getriggerte Pad aus. Die Anschlagst\u00e4rke f\u00fcr jedes Pad ist jedoch festgelegt, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, wie stark Sie auf das Pad dr\u00fccken - Pad 1 verwendet die niedrigste Anschlagst\u00e4rke, w\u00e4hrend Pad 16 die h\u00f6chste Anschlagst\u00e4rke (127) verwendet.  \n20. Note Wiederholen: Wenn Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt halten, w\u00e4hrend Sie auf ein Pad dr\u00fccken, wird das \nPad immer wieder getriggert - und zwar entsprechend des aktuellen Tempos und der \nZeiteinteilungseinstellungen. Diese Taste kann als tempor\u00e4re oder einrastende Taste funktionieren. \nHinweis:  Sie k\u00f6nnen Note Wiederholen auch mit eine r internen oder externen MIDI-Clock-Quelle \nsynchronisieren. \n21. DAW-Steuerung:  Sie k\u00f6nnen diese Tasten so konfigurieren, dass HID-Nachrichten (Human Interface \nDevice) an Ihre DAW (Digital Audio Workstation - Ihre Musik-Software) gesendet werden. Um zu erfahren, wie Sie dies tun k\u00f6nnen, lesen Sie bitte den Abschnitt Bearbeitungsmodus: \u00dcber HID . \nTipp:  Sie k\u00f6nnen Zeit sparen, indem Sie diese Steuerelemente so konfigurieren, dass sie die h\u00e4ufig \nverwendeten Befehle an Ihre Software senden (z.B. Kopieren, Einf\u00fcgen, Speichern, Zoom etc.).  \n22. Preset: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um in den Preset-Modus zu gelangen, in dem Sie verschiedene \nPresets (oder Programme) w\u00e4hlen und laden k\u00f6nnen.  \n23. Bearbeiten: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um in den Bearbeitungsmodus zu gelangen, in dem Sie \nFunktionen von Keyboard, Pads, Drehreglern, Tast en und Fadern bzw. di e Standardeinstellungen \njedes Presets bearbeiten k\u00f6nnen. \n24. Global: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um in den Global-Modus zu gelangen, in dem Sie Ihre globalen \n(systemweiten) Einstellungen festlegen k\u00f6nnen  und Midi-Reset-Befehle ausf\u00fchren k\u00f6nnen. \n25. Programmwechsel: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um in den Programmwechselmodus zu gelangen, in \ndem ein Programmwechsel- oder Programm- und Bankwechselnachricht an ein Hardware- oder \nSoftware-Modul gesendet werden kann. \n26. Vorschau: Halten Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt und dr\u00fccken/bewegen Sie dann ein anderes \nSteuerelement am Keyboard, um den Wert zu sehen, den das Steuerelement senden wird, ohne  den \nWert tats\u00e4chlich zu senden. Dies verhindert das Senden von fehlerhaften Controller-Meldungen \naufgrund der physikalischen Position des Contro llers. (Dies ist n\u00fctzlich, wenn zwischen Control-\nBanken gewechselt wird, bei denen zum Beispiel di e physische Position eines Fader nicht dem letzten \nvon der Steuerung gesendeten Wert entspricht.)  \n \n 37  \n  \n27. Loop:  Halten Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt, um den Loop oder die Repeat-Funktion in Ihrer Software zu \naktivieren. Diese Taste wird als Transportsteuerung betrachtet, damit sie die gleichen Nachrichten wie \ndie anderen Transporttasten senden kann: MMC (MIDI Machine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/Stopp oder vorher zugewiesenen MIDI-CC-Werte. \nWichtig:  Um diese Funktion nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss Ihre Software eine Loop- oder Wiederhol-\nFunktion haben. Achten Sie au\u00dferdem darauf, dass Sie das MPK249 Preset verwenden, das nach \nIhrer jeweiligen Software benannt ist. Wenn Ihre Software \u00fcber kein entsprechendes MPK249 Preset \nverf\u00fcgt, konfigurieren Sie die Loop-Taste im B earbeitungsmodus, damit sie ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00df mit Ihrer \nSoftware kommuniziert.  \n28. Transporttasten: Diese f\u00fcnf speziellen Tasten senden konventionelle Transportsteuerbefehle. \nR\u00fccklauf , Vorspulen , Stopp , Wiedergabe  und Aufnahme . Diese Tasten k\u00f6nnen MMC (MIDI \nMachine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/ Stopp oder vorher zugewiesene MIDI-CC-Werte \nsenden.  \n \nR\u00fcckseite \n \n1. Stromversorgung: Wenn Sie in Ihrem Setup \nkeinen Computer verwenden m\u00f6chten (d.h., wenn \nSie das MPK249 verwenden, um ein externes \nMIDI-Modul zu steuern), dann verbinden Sie das \nMPK249 mit einer Steckdose mit einem optionalen Adapter (6 V DC, 1A, mittlerer Pin mit positiver Polarit\u00e4t, separat erh\u00e4ltlich). Alternativ \nk\u00f6nnen Sie den USB-Anschluss  des MPK249 \n\u00fcber ein Standard-USB-Ladeger\u00e4t (separat erh\u00e4ltlich) mit einer Steckdose verbinden. \n2. Kabelhalterung: Sie k\u00f6nnen das Netzkabel mit dieser Kabelhalterung sichern, um ein versehentliches \nTrennen zu verhindern. \n3. Netzschalter:  Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um das MPK249 ein- oder auszuschalten. \n4. Kensington Lock:  Sie k\u00f6nnen diesen Kensington Lock Sicherheits-Slot verwenden, um das MPK249 \nan einem Tisch oder einer anderen Oberfl\u00e4che zu befestigen. \n5. USB-Port: Verwenden Sie ein Standard-USB-Kabel, um diesen USB-Port mit Ihrem Computer zu \nverbinden. Der USB-Port  des Computers versorgt das MPK249 mit ausreichend Strom. Alternativ \nk\u00f6nnen Sie das MPK249 auch mit Strom versorgen, indem Sie diesen USB-Port \u00fcber ein Standard-\nUSB-Ladeger\u00e4t (separat erh\u00e4ltlich) mit einer Stec kdose verbinden. Diese Verbindung wird auch \nverwendet, um MIDI-Daten vom und zum Co mputer zu senden und zu empfangen. \nDiese Verbindung ist auch f\u00fcr das MIDI Out  und MIDI In  des MPK249 relevant: \n\u2022 Wenn ein externes Ger\u00e4t mit dem MIDI Out  verbunden ist, kann Ihr Computer MIDI-Meldungen \n\u00fcber diesen Weg senden: Computer \uf0c6 MPK249 \uf0c6 Externes Ger\u00e4t . \n\u2022 Wenn ein externes Ger\u00e4t mit dem MIDI In  verbunden ist, sendet das externe Ger\u00e4t MIDI-\nNachrichten auf diesem Weg: Externes Ger\u00e4t \uf0c6 MPK249 \uf0c6 Computer . MIDI-Meldungen \nk\u00f6nnen dann \u00fcber das MIDI-Out an ein extern es Ger\u00e4t gesendet werden, diese Meldungen \nm\u00fcssen zun\u00e4chst jedoch den Computer passieren. \n6. MIDI Out: Verwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbliches, f\u00fcnfpoliges MIDI-Kabel, um diesen Ausgang mit dem \nMIDI IN eines externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4ts zu verbin den (z.B. einem Synthesizer, Sequenzer, Drum-\nComputer etc.). \n7. MIDI In: Verwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbliches, f\u00fcnfpoliges MIDI-Kabel, um dieses MIDI In mit dem MIDI \nOut eines externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4ts zu verbinden (z .B. einem anderen MIDI-Controller). Die MIDI-\nNachrichten, die an dieses MIDI In gesendet werd en, werden \u00fcber den USB-Port an Ihren Computer \ngesendet. \n8. Expression-Pedal-Eingang: Schlie\u00dfen Sie ein optionales 1/4\" TRS Expression-Pedal an diesen \nEingang an.  \n9.

See the Global Mode: Keyboard  \nsection for more information. \n MIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent. The \navailable settings are Common, USB A1 \u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n Octave:  The keyboard's octave setting. The available range is -3 to +3, with 0 as the center \noctave. \n Transpose:  The keyboard's transposition (in half-steps). The available range is -36 to +36, \nwith 0 as the center position (no transposition). \n MIDI to DIN:  This determines whether or not MIDI data is sent to the MIDI Out ( On) or not \n(Off). MIDI data will be sent to MPK249's USB connection regardless of this setting. \n Aftertouch (Aft) : This determines whether or not the keyboard sends Aftertouch messages \n(On) or not ( Off). \nImportant:  Aftertouch refers to MIDI information sent when pressure is applied to a key after it \nhas been played and while it is being held down. Aftertouch is often used to control volume, \nvibrato and other parameters.  \n \n 12  \n  \nPads \n \nImportant:  Global Mode contains other parameters that affect the pads but are saved only \nwith the global settings, no t with the Preset. See the Global Mode: Pads section for more \ninformation. \n \nType:  The type of message that will be sent. The available settings are Note , Program \nChange , and Program Bank . \nTip: For more information about Program Change and Program Bank messages, please see \nthe Program Change Mode  chapter of this guide. \n MIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent.

The available settings are Off, Red, Orange , Amber , Yellow , Green , Green \nBlue , Aqua , Light  Blue , Blue , Purple , Pink , Hot Pink , Light  Purple , Light  Green , Light  Pink , \nGrey . \n Note Mode:  If Note  is the selected Type , this determines whether it is in Momentary  Mode \n(sends a Note On message only while pressed and held, sends a Note Off message when \nreleased) or Toggle  Mode (sends a continuous Note On message when pressed once, sends \nthe Note Off message when pressed once again). \n \n \n 14  \n  \nAssignable Knobs \n \nType:  The type of message that will be sent. The available settings are MIDI CC , Aftertouch \n(Aft), Increment/Decrement 1 ( Inc/Dec1 ), and Increment/Decrement 2 ( Inc/Dec2 ). \n \nMIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent. The \navailable settings are Common , USB  A1\u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n \nCC Number:  If MIDI CC  or Inc/Dec2  is the selected Type , this determines the MIDI CC \nnumber. The available range is 000\u2013127. \n \nMIDI to DIN:  This determines whether or not MIDI data is sent to the MIDI Out ( On) or not \n(Off). MIDI data will be sent to MPK249's USB connection regardless of this setting.  \n \nMin / Max:  If MIDI CC  or Aft is the selected Type , these determine the lowest ( Min) and \nhighest ( Max) values. (If Min i s  h i g h e r  t h a n  Max, the knob's polarity will be reversed.) The \navailable range is 000\u2013127. \n \nMSB / LSB:  If Inc/Dec1  is the selected Type , these determine the MSB (Most Significant Bit) \nand LSB (Least Significant Bit). The available range is 000\u2013127. \nTip: For more information about Program Change and Program Bank messages, please see \nthe Program Change Mode  chapter of this guide. \n \nValue:  If Inc/Dec1  is the selected Type , this determines the value sent by an Increment (CC \n#96) or Decrement (CC #97) message. The available range is 000\u2013127. \n \n \n 15  \n  \nAssignable Faders \n \nType:  The type of message that will be sent. The available settings are MIDI CC  and \nAftertouch ( Aft). \nImportant:  Aftertouch refers to MIDI information sent when pressure is applied to a key or pad \nafter it has been played and while it is being held down.

See the Edit Mode: Keyboard  section for more \ninformation. \n \nCurve:  The keyboard's velocity curve. The available range is -50 to +50. At a low value, the \ncurve is flatter at low velocities, becoming much steeper at high velocities. At a high value, the \ncurve is steeper at low velocities, becoming flatter at high velocities. At the maximum setting \nof +50, it takes very little force to generate a velocity value of 127. \n \nGain:  An offset to keyboard's overall velocity sensitivity. The available range is -20 to +20. At a \nlow value, more force is required to generate a note. At a high value, less force is required to generate a note. \n \nBlack / White:  An offset to the black keys' or white keys' overall velocity sensitivity. The \navailable range is -20 to +20. At a low value, more force is required to generate a note. At a \nhigh value, less force is required to generate a note. \nTip: These parameters are useful if you play the black keys and white keys differently (e.g., \ndue to the higher position of the black keys, your preferred hand positioning, etc.).  \n \n 25  \n  \nPads \n \nImportant:  Edit Mode contains other parameters that affect the pads but are saved only with \nthe Preset, not with the global settings. See the Edit Mode: Pads  section for more \ninformation. \n \nPad Threshold:  The velocity threshold to trigger the pads. The available range is 0\u201315.

This \nhelps you avoid sending erroneous controller messages due to the physical position of \nthe controller. (This is useful when switching between control banks where, for example, \nthe physical position of a fader may not correspond to the last value sent by the \ncontroller.)  \n27. Loop:  Press and hold this button to activate th e Loop or Repeat feature in your software. \nThis button is considered a transport control, so it can be set to send the same messages as the other transport control buttons: MMC (MIDI Machine Control), \nMMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/Stop, or  pre-assigned MIDI CC values. \nImportant:  Y o u r  s o f t w a r e  m u s t  b e  a b l e  t o  l o o p  o r  r e p e a t  i n  o r d e r  t o  u s e  t h i s  f e a t u r e .  \nAlso, make sure that you are using the MPK249 Preset named after your particular \nsoftware. If your software does not have a corresponding MPK249 Preset, configure the \nLoop button in Edit Mode so it communicates properly with your software.  \n28. Transport Control Buttons: These five buttons are dedicated buttons for sending \nconventional transport control commands: Rewind , Fast-Forward , Stop , Play, and \nRecord . These can be set to send MMC (MIDI Machine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI \nStart/Stop, or pre-assigned MIDI CC values.  \n \n 33  \n  \nRear Panel \n \n1. Power Input: If you do not want to use \na computer in your setup (i.e., if you are using MPK249 to control an external \nMIDI module), connect MPK249's power \ninput to a power outlet using an optional \npower adapter (6V DC, 1A, center-\npositive, sold separately). Alternatively, \nyou can connect MPK249's USB Port  to \na power outlet using a standard USB charger (sold separately). \n2. Power Adapter Restraint: You can secure a power adapter cord to this restraint to help \navoid disconnecting it accidentally. \n3. Power Switch:  Press this button to power the MPK249 on or off. \n4. Kensington Lock:  You may use this Kensington lock slot to secure the MPK249 to a \ntable or other surface. \n5. USB Port: Use a standard USB cable to connect this USB port to your computer. The \ncomputer's USB port provides ample power to MPK249. You can also power MPK249 by \nconnecting this USB port to a power outlet using a standard USB charger (sold \nseparately). This connection is also used to send and receive MIDI data to and from your \ncomputer. \nThis connection is also  relevant to MPK249's MIDI Out  and MIDI In : \n\u2022 If an external device is connected to the MIDI Out , your computer can send MIDI \nmessages out along this path: Computer \uf0c6 MPK249 \uf0c6 External Device . \n\u2022 If an external device is connected to the MIDI In , the external device sends MIDI \nmessages in along this path: External Device \uf0c6 MPK249 \uf0c6 Computer . MIDI \nmessages can then be sent to an external device via the MIDI Out, but it must pass \nthrough the computer first. \n6. MIDI Out: Use a standard five-pin MIDI cable to co nnect this MIDI Out to the MIDI In of \nan external MIDI device (e.g., a synthesizer, sequencer, drum machine, etc.). 12\n34\n56789\n \n 34  \n  \n7. MIDI In: Use a standard five-pin MIDI cable to connect this MIDI In to the MIDI Out of an \nexternal MIDI device (e.g., another MIDI controller). The MIDI messages sent to this MIDI In will be sent to your computer via the USB port. \n8. Expression Pedal Input: Connect an optional 1/4\" TRS expr ession pedal to this input.  \n9. Sustain Pedal Input: Connect an optional 1/4\" TS sustain pedal or footswitch to this \ninput. (You can configure the connected pedal to control the keyboard's sustain, to send a MIDI CC message, or  other messages.) \n \n \n 35  \n  \nAppendix \n \nMode Parameters \n \nEdit Mode \n \nTo edit a control's parameters, press Edit then move or press that control.  \n \nControl  Parameter Settings \nKeyboard MIDI Channel \nOctave Transpose MIDI to DIN Aftertouch Common, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n-3 to +3 -36 to +36 On, Off On, Off \nAssignable \nPads Type \nMIDI Channel Note Aftertouch (Aft) MIDI to DIN On Color \n  \nOff Color \n \nNote Mode Note\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \nC-1 to G9 Off, Channel Aftertouch (Ch), Poly Aftertouch (Poly) On, Off Off, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light Blue, \nBlue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light Blue, \nBlue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nMomentary, Toggle \n \n 36  \n  \nControl Parameter Settings \nAssignable \nPads \n(continued)  Type \nMIDI Channel \nProgram Number \nMIDI to DIN \nOn Color \n \nOff Color Program Change\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 \nOn, Off \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light Blue, \nBlue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light Blue, \nBlue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey  \nType \nMIDI Channel \nProgram (Pgm) MSB \nLSB \nMIDI to DIN On Color \n  \nOff Color Program Bank\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 \n000\u2013127 \nOn, Off \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light Blue, \nBlue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nOff, Red, Orange, Amber, Yellow, Green, Green Blue, Aqua, Light Blue, \nBlue, Purple, Pink, Hot Pink, Light Purple, Light Green, Light Pink, Grey \nAssignable \nFaders Type \nMIDI Channel CC Number \nMIDI to DIN \nMin \nMax MIDI CC\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 000\u2013127 \nOn, Off  000\u2013127 \n000\u2013127  \nType \nMIDI Channel \nMin \nMax MIDI to DIN Aftertouch (Aft)\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 000\u2013127 \n000\u2013127 On, Off  \n \n 37  \n  \nControl Parameter Settings \nAssignable \nKnobs Type \nMIDI Channel CC Number \nMIDI to DIN \nMin Max MIDI CC\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 On, Off 000\u2013127 000\u2013127\nType MIDI Channel Min Max MIDI to DIN Aftertouch\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 On, Off \nType MIDI Channel MSB LSB MIDI to DIN Value Inc/Dec1\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 On, Off 000\u2013127 \nType MIDI Channel \nCC Number \nMIDI to DIN Inc/Dec2\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 On, Off \n \n 38  \n  \nControl Parameter Settings \nAssignable \nSwitches Type \nMIDI Channel \nCC Number \nMIDI to DIN  \nMode Invert CC\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 \nOn, Off \nMomentary, Toggle On, Off  \nType \nMIDI Channel \nNote \nVelocity (Velo) \nMIDI to DIN  Mode Note\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \nC-1 to G9 \n000\u2013127 \nOn, Off Momentary, Toggle \nType \nMIDI Channel \nProgram Number \nMIDI to DIN Program Change (PrgChange)\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n000\u2013127 \nOn, Off \nType \nMIDI Channel Program (Pgm) \nMSB \nLSB \nMIDI to DIN Program Bank (PrgBank)\nCommon, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 000\u2013127 \n000\u2013127 000\u2013127 \nOn, Off \nType \nKey 1 \n  \nKey 2 Keystroke\n0\u20139, A\u2013Z, F1\u2013F12, Backspace, Return , Up Arrow, Down Arrow, Left \nArrow, Right Arrow, Tab, various symbo ls ( , . / [ ] \\ ' ;

A Preset  is a \ncollection of information about how the faders, knobs, buttons, and pads will behave. Using Presets allows you to save different configurations so you can \nload them quickly without reprogramming  the MPK261 every ti me. This is also \nthe default \"performance mode.\" \n \nTo load a Preset: \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Turn the Value Dial  to select the desired Preset, which will appear in the display. \n3. To load the selected Preset, press the Value Dial . \nTo cancel the operation and return to the current Preset, press Preset  or just wait a few \nseconds. \n \nTo edit a Preset,  please see the Edit Mode  section of this chapter. \n \nTo save or copy a Preset: \nNote:  Saving and copying a Preset are mostly the same operation. The difference is that \nsaving a Preset will save it to the same/origina l Preset number while copying a Preset will save \nit to a different Preset number. \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Press the Right Cursor  button. Store Program  will appear in the display.  \n3. If you want to save it to the current Preset, press the Value Dial .  \nIf you want to save/copy it to  a different Preset, turn the Value Dial  to select the desired \nPreset number ( Copy Program  will appear in the display), and then press the Value Dial .  \nTo cancel the operation, press Preset . \n \nTo name or rename a Preset: 1.

To restore MPK261's fact ory default Pres ets (which overwrites those you have saved), \npress the Value Dial . \nTo cancel the operation, press \nPreset . \n \n \n 5  \n  \nEdit Mode \n \nIn Edit Mode, you can edit the settings of the currently selected Preset. The \nsettings vary depending on the controller you are editing and are listed in the \nAppendix: Mode Parameters  section. Please note that the changes you make \nwill only apply to the currently selected Preset. \n \nTo navigate Edit Mode: \n1. Press Edit to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Select a control to edit (fader, pad, button, etc.) by moving or pressing it. The selected \ncontrol and its editable parameters will appear in the display. \n3. In each page of Edit Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move through the parameters on \nthe current page. \n\u2022 If there are multiple pages (indicated by Pg1, Pg2, etc.), use the Left Cursor  and \nRight Cursor  buttons to move between different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. \n4. To edit more controls, repeat Steps 2-3. \nTo return to a normal performance mode, press Preset . \nImportant:  Save the Preset to retain your edits. Without saving, these changes will be lost if \nyou load a new Preset. See the Preset Mode  section to learn how save your Preset. \n \nFor an overview of the available controls and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode \nParameters  section. \n \n \nAbout HID \nThe HID (Human Interface Device) protocol lets devices send typical computer keyboard \nkeystrokes. USB game controllers are an example of this, acting as an alternative to your \ncomputer's keyboard. MPK261 can also use the HID protocol, letting you configure certain \nbuttons to send your most-often used keystrokes to your software, so you no longer need to \nswitch focus constantly between the co mputer's keyboard and your MPK261. \n \nTo configure a control to use the HID protocol: \n1. Press Edit to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Select one of the Assignable Switches  or DAW Control Buttons  by pressing it. The \nselected button and its editable parameters will appear in the display. \n3. Turn the Value Dial  to change the Type  field to HID. \n4. Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to select the Key#1  field, and turn the \nValue Dial  to change it to the desired keystroke.  \n5. If your desired keystroke requires one or more modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Command, etc.), \nrepeat Step 4 for Key#2 , which lets you select different combinations of 1-3 modifier \nkeys.  \nImportant:  Save the Preset to retain your edits. Without saving, these changes will be lost if \nyou load a new Preset. See the Preset Mode  section to learn how save your Preset. \n \n \n6 \n  \nGlobal Mode \n  \nGlobal Mode lets you set parameters and make  changes to MPK261's general (\"global\") \nfunctioning. These settings are not specific to a Preset; th ey affect all Presets.  \n \n \nTo navigate Global Mode: \n1. Press Global  to enter Global Mode. \n2. In each page of Global Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move throug h the parameters on the \ncurrent page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently  selected value/setting. \n3. To save the new Global Mode settings, use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to \nselect the Save Globals  page, and press the Value Di al to confirm the operation. \nTo cancel the operation instead, use the Left Cursor  or Right Cursor  buttons to select another \npage, or press Global .  \n \nTo restore the factory default Global Mode settings: \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Press the Left Cursor  button so Factory Defaults  appears in the display. \n3. Turn the Value Dial  and select Globals . \n4. To restore MPK261's factor y default Global Mode settings (whi ch overwrites those you have \nsaved), press the Value Dial . \nTo cancel the operation, press Preset . \n \nFor an overview of the availabl e settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode Parameters  \nsection. \n \nProgram Change Mode \n \nA Program Change , often referred to as a Patch Change , is a MIDI message from one \ndevice to another that causes the latter to switch to a new program. Using Program \nChange messages, MPK261 can tell another ha rdware or software device which sound \nto play. \nFor example, if your MPK261 is controlling a piano pat ch in your software or an external MIDI device, \nsending a Program Change message from MPK261  causes it to switch to a synth patch.  \n \nThe MPK261 lets you send two types of Program Change messages: \n\u2022 Program Change: This is a standard Program Change message (0-127) sent to your software \nor external device, letting you switch  between 128 differ ent program banks. \n\u2022 Program Change with Bank Change: This is a standard Progra m Change message (0-127) \nplus a Bank Select LSB (Least Significant Bit) (0-127) and a Bank Select  MSB  (Most Significant \nBit) message (0-127). This gives you access to up to 16384 different program banks. Your \nsoftware or external device must support LSB and MSB mess ages to use th is feature. \n \nTo navigate Program Change Mode: \n1. Press Program Change  to enter Program Change Mode. \n2.

Mit Programmwechsel kann das MPK261 anderen Hardware- oder \nSoftware-Ger\u00e4ten mitteilen, welche Sounds abzuspielen sind. \nWenn Ihr MPK261 beispielsweise einen Klavier-Patch in Ihrer Software oder einem externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4t \nsteuert, kann das Senden einer Programmwechselnachricht vom MPK261 bewirken, dass zu einem Synthesizer-Patch gewechselt wird.  \n \nDas MPK261 kann zwei Arten von Programmwechselnachrichten senden: \n\u2022 Programmwechsel: Dies ist eine standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Programmwechselnachricht (0-127), die an Ihre \nSoftware oder Ihr externes Ger\u00e4t gesendet wird, damit Sie zwischen 128 verschiedenen \nProgrammbanken wechseln k\u00f6nnen. \n\u2022 Programmwechsel mit Bankwechsel: Dies ist eine standardm\u00e4\u00dfige Programmwechselnachricht (0-\n127) MIT einer Bankauswahlnachricht LSB  (Least Significant Bit - niedrigstwertiges Bit) (0-127) und \neiner Bankauswahlnachricht MSB  (Most Significant Bit - h\u00f6chstwertiges Byte) (0-127). Damit haben \nSie Zugriff auf bis zu 16384 verschiedene Programmbanken. Ihre Software oder externes Ger\u00e4t muss \nLSB- und MSB-Befehle unterst\u00fctzen, um diese Funktion zu nutzen. \n \nSo navigieren Sie im Programmwechselmodus: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Programmwechsel (Program Change) , um in den Programmwechselmodus zu \ngelangen. \n2. Auf jeder Seite des Programmwechselmodus: \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die Cursor-Tasten f\u00fcr aufw\u00e4rts  und abw\u00e4rts , um durch die Parameter auf der \naktuellen Seite zu bl\u00e4ttern. \n\u2022 Verwenden Sie die linken  und rechten  Cursor-Tasten, um zwischen den verschiedenen Seiten \nzu wechseln. \n\u2022 Drehen Sie das Datenrad , um den/die aktuell ausgew\u00e4hlte/n Wert bzw. Einstellung zu \u00e4ndern. \nWichtig:  Diese Ver\u00e4nderungen k\u00f6nnen nicht mit Ihren Presets oder globalen Einstellungen \ngespeichert werden. Nach dem Ausschalten des MPK261 werden sie wieder auf die \nStandardeinstellungen zur\u00fcckgesetzt. \n \nEine \u00dcbersicht der verf\u00fcgbaren Einstellungen und Parameter finden Sie im Anhang:  Modusparameter . \n \n 35  \n  \nFunktionen \n \nOberseite \n \n114 1522\n28 28 28 28 2823 24 25 26 27\n15 15 22345\n678 9\n10\n1617 2118\n19\n17\n2017\n1711\n12\n13 13 13 13 13 13 13 1312 12 12 12 12 12 1211 11 11 11 11 11 11\n \n \n1.

Diese Taste kann als tempor\u00e4re oder einrastende Taste funktionieren.  \nWichtig:  W\u00e4hrend die Zeiteinteilung  aktiv ist, werden die zuweisbaren Schalter  solange keine ihrer \nnormalen MIDI CC- oder Programmwechselnachrichten senden bis die Zeiteinteilung deaktiviert \nwurde. \n15. Control-Bank-Tasten:  Verwenden Sie diese Tasten, um eine von drei unabh\u00e4ngigen Continuous \nController Banken auszuw\u00e4hlen. Mit diesen Tasten k\u00f6nnen Sie mit den Reglern, Fadern und Schaltern \nbis zu 72 unabh\u00e4ngige Parameter steuern. \n16. Pads: Verwenden Sie diese Pads, um Drum-Hits oder andere Samples in Ihrer Software oder Ihrem \nexternen MIDI-Soundmodul anzusteuern. Die Pads  sind anschlagdynamisch und druckempfindlich, \nwas sie besonders reaktionsf\u00e4hig und intuitiv spielbar macht. \n17. Pad-Bank: Verwenden Sie diese Tasten, um eine von vier unabh\u00e4ngigen Pad-Banken auszuw\u00e4hlen. \nJede Pad-Bank kann ein einzigartiges Sample-Set enthalten, so dass Sie Zugriff auf bis zu 48 \nverschiedene Sounds erhalten. \n18. Full Level: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um den Full Level-Mo dus zu aktivieren, in  dem die Pads immer \nmit der maximalen Anschlagst\u00e4rke (127) abgespielt  werden, egal wie stark oder schwach die Pads \nbet\u00e4tigt werden. \n19. 16 Level: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Schaltfl\u00e4che, um den 16 Level-Modus zu aktivieren, in dem das zuletzt \nausgel\u00f6ste Pad allen 16 Pads zugeordnet wird. Alle 16 Pads geben nun die gleiche Notennummer wie \ndas zuletzt getriggerte Pad aus. Die Anschlagst\u00e4rke f\u00fcr jedes Pad ist jedoch festgelegt, unabh\u00e4ngig davon, wie stark Sie auf das Pad dr\u00fccken - Pad 1 verwendet die niedrigste Anschlagst\u00e4rke, w\u00e4hrend Pad 16 die h\u00f6chste Anschlagst\u00e4rke (127) verwendet.  \n20. Note Wiederholen: Wenn Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt halten, w\u00e4hrend Sie auf ein Pad dr\u00fccken, wird das \nPad immer wieder getriggert - und zwar entsprechend des aktuellen Tempos und der \nZeiteinteilungseinstellungen. Diese Taste kann als tempor\u00e4re oder einrastende Taste funktionieren. \nHinweis:  Sie k\u00f6nnen Note Wiederholen auch mit eine r internen oder externen MIDI-Clock-Quelle \nsynchronisieren. \n21. DAW-Steuerung:  Sie k\u00f6nnen diese Tasten so konfigurieren, dass HID-Nachrichten (Human Interface \nDevice) an Ihre DAW (Digital Audio Workstation - Ihre Musik-Software) gesendet werden. Um zu \nerfahren, wie Sie dies tun k\u00f6nnen, lesen Sie bitte den Abschnitt Bearbeitungsmodus: \u00dcber HID . \nTipp:  Sie k\u00f6nnen Zeit sparen, indem Sie diese Steuerelemente so konfigurieren, dass sie die h\u00e4ufig \nverwendeten Befehle an Ihre Software senden (z.B. Kopieren, Einf\u00fcgen, Speichern, Zoom etc.).  \n22. Preset: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um in den Preset-Modus zu gelangen, in dem Sie verschiedene \nPresets (oder Programme) w\u00e4hlen und laden k\u00f6nnen.  \n23.

Programmwechsel: Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, um in den Programmwechselmodus zu gelangen, in \ndem ein Programmwechsel- oder Programm- und Bankwechselnachricht an ein Hardware- oder \nSoftware-Modul gesendet werden kann. \n26. Vorschau: Halten Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt und dr\u00fccken/bewegen Sie dann ein anderes \nSteuerelement am Keyboard, um den Wert zu sehen, den das Steuerelement senden wird, ohne  den \nWert tats\u00e4chlich zu senden. Dies verhindert das Senden von fehlerhaften Controller-Meldungen \naufgrund der physikalischen Position des Contro llers. (Dies ist n\u00fctzlich, wenn zwischen Control-\nBanken gewechselt wird, bei denen zum Beispiel di e physische Position eines Fader nicht dem letzten \nvon der Steuerung gesendeten Wert entspricht.)  \n \n 37  \n  \n27. Loop:  Halten Sie diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt, um den Loop oder die Repeat-Funktion in Ihrer Software zu \naktivieren. Diese Taste wird als Transportsteuerung betrachtet, damit sie die gleichen Nachrichten wie \ndie anderen Transporttasten senden kann: MMC (MIDI Machine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/Stopp oder vorher zugewiesenen MIDI-CC-Werte. \nWichtig:  Um diese Funktion nutzen zu k\u00f6nnen, muss Ihre Software eine Loop- oder Wiederhol-\nFunktion haben. Achten Sie au\u00dferdem darauf, dass Sie das MPK261 Preset verwenden, das nach \nIhrer jeweiligen Software benannt ist. Wenn Ihre Software \u00fcber kein entsprechendes MPK261 Preset \nverf\u00fcgt, konfigurieren Sie die Loop-Taste im B earbeitungsmodus, damit sie ordnungsgem\u00e4\u00df mit Ihrer \nSoftware kommuniziert.  \n28. Transporttasten: Diese f\u00fcnf speziellen Tasten senden konventionelle Transportsteuerbefehle. \nR\u00fccklauf , Vorspulen , Stopp , Wiedergabe  und Aufnahme . Diese Tasten k\u00f6nnen MMC (MIDI \nMachine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/ Stopp oder vorher zugewiesene MIDI-CC-Werte \nsenden.  \n \nR\u00fcckseite \n \n1.

USB-Port: Verwenden Sie ein Standard-USB-Kabel, um diesen USB-Port mit Ihrem Computer zu \nverbinden. Der USB-Port  des Computers versorgt das MPK261 mit ausreichend Strom. Alternativ \nk\u00f6nnen Sie das MPK261 auch mit Strom versorgen, indem Sie diesen USB-Port \u00fcber ein Standard-\nUSB-Ladeger\u00e4t (separat erh\u00e4ltlich) mit einer Stec kdose verbinden. Diese Verbindung wird auch \nverwendet, um MIDI-Daten vom und zum Co mputer zu senden und zu empfangen. \nDiese Verbindung ist auch f\u00fcr das MIDI Out  und MIDI In  des MPK261 relevant: \n\u2022 Wenn ein externes Ger\u00e4t mit dem MIDI Out  verbunden ist, kann Ihr Computer MIDI-Meldungen \n\u00fcber diesen Weg senden: Computer \uf0c6 MPK261 \uf0c6 Externes Ger\u00e4t . \n\u2022 Wenn ein externes Ger\u00e4t mit dem MIDI In  verbunden ist, sendet das externe Ger\u00e4t MIDI-\nNachrichten auf diesem Weg: Externes Ger\u00e4t \uf0c6 MPK261 \uf0c6 Computer . MIDI-Meldungen \nk\u00f6nnen dann \u00fcber das MIDI-Out an ein extern es Ger\u00e4t gesendet werden, diese Meldungen \nm\u00fcssen zun\u00e4chst jedoch den Computer passieren. \n6. MIDI Out: Verwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbliches, f\u00fcnfpoliges MIDI-Kabel, um diesen Ausgang mit dem \nMIDI IN eines externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4ts zu verbin den (z.B. einem Synthesizer, Sequenzer, Drum-\nComputer etc.). \n7. MIDI In: Verwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbliches, f\u00fcnfpoliges MIDI-Kabel, um dieses MIDI In mit dem MIDI \nOut eines externen MIDI-Ger\u00e4ts zu verbinden (z .B. einem anderen MIDI-Controller). Die MIDI-\nNachrichten, die an dieses MIDI In gesendet werd en, werden \u00fcber den USB-Port an Ihren Computer \ngesendet. \n8. Expression-Pedal-Eingang: Schlie\u00dfen Sie ein optionales 1/4\" TRS Expression-Pedal an diesen \nEingang an.  \n9. Fu\u00dfschaltereingang: Schlie\u00dfen Sie ein optionales 1/4\" TS Sustain-Pedal oder einen Fu\u00dfschalter an \ndiesem Eingang an.

Select a control to edit (fader, pad, button, etc.) by moving or pressing it. The selected \ncontrol and its editable parameters will appear in the display. \n3. In each page of Edit Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move through the parameters on \nthe current page. \n\u2022 If there are multiple pages (indicated by Pg1, Pg2, etc.), use the Left Cursor  and \nRight Cursor  buttons to move between different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. \n4. To edit more controls, repeat Steps 2\u20133. \nTo return to a normal performance mode, press Preset . \nImportant:  Save the Preset to retain your edits. Without saving, these changes will be lost if \nyou load a new Preset. See the Preset Mode  section to learn how save your Preset. \n \nEach section of this chapter is dedicated to a specific control and lists its editable parameters. \n \nFor an overview of the available controls and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode \nParameters  section. \n \n \n 11  \n  \nKeyboard \n \nImportant:  Global Mode contains other parameters that affect the keyboard but are saved \nonly with global settings and not with the current Preset. See the Global Mode: Keyboard  \nsection for more information. \n MIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent. The \navailable settings are Common, USB A1 \u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n Octave:  The keyboard's octave setting. The available range is -3 to +3, with 0 as the center \noctave. \n Transpose:  The keyboard's transposition (in half-steps). The available range is -36 to +36, \nwith 0 as the center position (no transposition). \n MIDI to DIN:  This determines whether or not MIDI data is sent to the MIDI Out ( On) or not \n(Off). MIDI data will be sent to MPK261's USB connection regardless of this setting. \n Aftertouch (Aft): This determines whether or not the keyboard sends Aftertouch messages \n(On) or not ( Off). \nImportant:  Aftertouch refers to MIDI information sent when pressure is applied to a key after it \nhas been played and while it is being held down. Aftertouch is often used to control volume, \nvibrato and other parameters.  \n \n 12  \n  \nSplit:  This determines if the physical keyboard is split into two separate zones ( On) or not \n(Off). You can set each zone to send its notes over different MIDI channels (or the same one) \nor set certain controls (e.g., Pitch-Bend Wheel, Modulation Wheel, Footswitch, etc.) to affect \none zone, both zones, or neither. \nIf this is set to On, the following additional parameters will be available. ( A refers to the zone \non the left side of the Split Note. B refers to the zone on the right side of the Split Note.) \n\u2022 Split Note:  This setting determines the key where the Split Note is located. The \navailable range is 000 (the lowest key on the keyboard) to 060 (the highest key on \nthe keyboard. \n\u2022 B Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel data from the B zone \nis sent. The available settings are Common , USB  A1\u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n\u2022 Pitch Bend Wheel:  This setting determines which zones are affected by the Pitch-\nBend Wheel. The available settings are Off, A, B, and A+B. \n\u2022 Modulation Wheel (ModWheel):  This setting determines which zones are affected \nby the Modulation Wheel. The available settings are Off, A, B, and A+B. \n\u2022 Footswitch 1:  This setting determines which zones are affected by a pedal \nconnected to the Footswitch 1 in put. The available settings are Off, A, B, and A+B. \n\u2022 Footswitch 2:  This setting determines which zones are affected by a pedal \nconnected to the Footswitch 2 in put. The available settings are Off, A, B, and A+B. \n\u2022 Expression Pedal:  This setting determines which zones are affected by a pedal \nconnected to the Expression Pedal input. The available settings are Off, A, B, and \nA+B. \n\u2022 Arpeggiator:  This setting determines which zones are affected by the Arpeggiator. \nThe available settings are Off, A, B, and A+B. \n\u2022 Aftertouch:  This setting determines which zo nes can send Aftertouch messages. \nThe available settings are Off, A, B, and A+B. \n \n \n 13  \n  \nPads \n \nImportant:  Global Mode contains other parameters that affect the pads but are saved only \nwith the global settings, no t with the Preset. See the Global Mode: Pads section for more \ninformation. \n \nType:  The type of message that will be sent. The available settings are Note , Program \nChange , and Program Bank . \nTip: For more information about Program Change and Program Bank messages, please see \nthe Program Change Mode  chapter of this guide. \n \nMIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent. The \navailable settings are Common , USB  A1\u2013A16, and USB  B1\u2013B16. \n Note:  If Note  is the selected Type , this assigns the note numb er the pad will send when \nplayed. \n \nAftertouch (Aft): This determines the pad's Aftertouch settings. The available options are Off, \nChannel Aftertouch ( Ch), and Poly Aftertouch ( Poly). \nImportant:  Aftertouch refers to MIDI information sent when pressure is applied to a pad after it \nhas been played and while it is being held down. Aftertouch is often used to control volume, \nvibrato and other parameters. When set to Poly, the pad will transmit Aftertouch information \nindependently from the ot her pads. When set to Ch, all pads assigned to a particular MIDI \nChannel will transmit Aftertouch information as a group (applying pressure to any pad \nassigned to the same MIDI channel will send Aftertouch information). \n \nProgram Number (Pgm):  If Program Change  or Program Bank  is the selected Type , this \ndetermines the Program number.

See the Edit Mode: Keyboard  section for more \ninformation. \n \nCurve:  The keyboard's velocity curve. The available range is -50 to +50. At a low value, the \ncurve is flatter at low velocities, becoming much steeper at high velocities. At a high value, the \ncurve is steeper at low velocities, becoming flatter at high velocities. At the maximum setting \nof +50, it takes very little force to generate a velocity value of 127. \n \nGain:  An offset to keyboard's overall velocity sensitivity. The available range is -20 to +20. At a \nlow value, more force is required to generate a note. At a high value, less force is required to generate a note. \n \nBlack / White:  An offset to the black keys' or white keys' overall velocity sensitivity. The \navailable range is -20 to +20. At a low value, more force is required to generate a note. At a \nhigh value, less force is required to generate a note. \nTip: These parameters are useful if you play the black keys and white keys differently (e.g., \ndue to the higher position of the black keys, your preferred hand positioning, etc.).  \n \n 26  \n  \nPads \n \nImportant:  Edit Mode contains other parameters that affect the pads but are saved only with \nthe Preset, not with the global settings.

For example, if your MPK261 is \ncontrolling a piano patch in your software or an external MIDI device, sending a \nProgram Change message from  MPK261 causes it to switch to a synth patch.  \n \nMPK261 lets you send two types of Program Change messages: \n\u2022 Program Change: This is a standard Program Change  message (0\u2013127) sent to your \nsoftware or external  device, letting you switch betw een 128 different program banks. \n\u2022 Program Change with Bank Change: This is a standard Program Change message (0\u2013\n127) plus a Bank Select LSB (Least Significant Bit) (0\u2013127) and a Bank Select  MSB  (Most \nSignificant Bit) me ssage (0\u2013127). This give s you access to up to  16384 differ ent program \nbanks. Your software or external device must support LSB and MSB messages to use \nthis feature. \n \nTo navigate Program Change Mode: \n1. Press Program Change  to enter Program Change Mode. \n2. In each page of Program Change Mode: \n\u2022 Use the Up Cursor  and Down Cursor  buttons to move through the parameters on \nthe current page. \n\u2022 Use the Left Cursor  and Right Cursor  buttons to move betw een different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Value Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. \nImportant:  These changes cannot be saved to your Presets or global settings. Once you \npower off the MPK261 they will re turn to the default settings. \n \nEach section of this chapter is dedicated to a specific Program Change and lists its editable \nparameters. \nFor an overview of the available settings and parameters, see the Appendix:  Mode \nParameters  section. \n \n 29  \n  \nProgram Change \n \nMIDI Channel:  This setting determines over which MIDI channel the messages are sent.

Time Division: Press this button and then press one of the Assignable Switches  to \nselect the current Time Division, which determines the rate of the Note Repeat and \nArpeggiator features. This button can function as a momentary or toggle (latching) button.  \nImportant:  While Time Division  is active, the Assignable Switches  will not send any of \ntheir normal MIDI CC or Program Change messages until Time Division has been \ndeactivated. \n15. Control Bank Buttons: Use these buttons to select one of three independent banks of \ncontinuous controllers. This le ts you control up to 72 inde pendent parameters with the \nknobs, faders, and switches. \n16. Pads: Use these pads to trigger drum  hits or other samples in your software or external \nMIDI sound module. The pads are pressure- and velocity-sensitive, which makes them \nvery responsive and intuitive to play. \n17. Pad Bank: Use these buttons to select one of four independent banks of pads. Each pad \nbank can contain a unique set of samples, giving you access of up to 48 different \nsounds. \n18. Full Level: Press this button to activate Full Level Mode in which the pads always play at \na maximum velocity (127) , no matter how hard or soft you hit them. \n19. 16 Level: Press this button to activate 16 Level Mode in which the last-triggered pad is \nmapped to all 16 pads. All 16 pads will now output the same note number and pressure controller as the last-triggered pad, but the velocity for each pad is fixed, regardless of \nhow hard you hit them\u2014Pad 1 plays at the lowest velocity while Pad 16 plays at the \nmaximum velocity (127).  \n20. Note Repeat: Press and hold this button while st riking a pad to cause the pad to \nretrigger at a rate based on the current Te mpo and Time Division settings. This button \ncan function as a momentary or toggle (latching) button. \nNote:  You can also sync Note Repeat to an internal or external MIDI Clock source. \n \n 33  \n  \n21. DAW Control:  You can configure these buttons to send HID (Human Interface Device) \nmessages to your DAW (digital audio workstation\u2014your music software). To learn how to \ndo this, please see the Edit Mode: Assignable Switches and DAW Control  section. \nTip: You can save time by conf iguring these controls to send your most-often-used \ncommands to your software (e.g., copy, paste, save, zoom, etc.).  \n22. Preset: Press this button to enter Preset Mode where you can select and load different \nPresets (or Programs). \n23. Edit: Press this button to enter Edit Mode wh ere you can edit the functions of the \nkeyboard, pads, knobs, buttons, and faders as  well as each Preset's default settings. \n24. Global: Press this button to enter Global Mode where you can set yo ur global (system-\nwide) preferences and execute MIDI reset commands. \n25. Program Change: Press this button to enter Program Change Mode where you can send \na Program Change or Program With Bank Change message to a hardware or software \nmodule. \n26. Preview: Press and hold this button, and then press or move another control on the \nkeyboard to see the value that control will send without  actually sending the value. This \nhelps you avoid sending erroneous controller messages due to the physical position of \nthe controller. (This is useful when switching between control banks where, for example, \nthe physical position of a fader may not correspond to the last value sent by the \ncontroller.)  \n27. Loop:  Press and hold this button to activate th e Loop or Repeat feature in your software. \nThis button is considered a transport control, so it can be set to send the same messages as the other transport control buttons: MMC (MIDI Machine Control), \nMMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI Start/Stop, or  pre-assigned MIDI CC values. \nImportant:  Y o u r  s o f t w a r e  m u s t  b e  a b l e  t o  l o o p  o r  r e p e a t  i n  o r d e r  t o  u s e  t h i s  f e a t u r e .  \nAlso, make sure that you are using the MPK261 Preset named after your particular \nsoftware. If your software does not have a corresponding MPK261 Preset, configure the \nLoop button in Edit Mode so it communicates properly with your software.  \n28. Transport Control Buttons: These five buttons are dedicated buttons for sending \nconventional transport control commands: Rewind , Fast-Forward , Stop , Play, and \nRecord . These can be set to send MMC (MIDI Machine Control), MMC/MIDI SysEx, MIDI \nStart/Stop, or pre-assigned MIDI CC values.  \n \n 34  \n  \nRear Panel \n \n1. Power Input: If you do not want to use \na computer in your setup (i.e., if you are using MPK261 to control an external \nMIDI module), connect MPK261's power \ninput to a power outlet using an optional \npower adapter (6V DC, 1A, center-\npositive, sold separately). Alternatively, \nyou can connect MPK261's USB Port  to a power outlet using a standard USB charger \n(sold separately). \n2. Power Adapter Restraint: You can secure a power adapter cord to this restraint to help \navoid disconnecting it accidentally. \n3. Power Switch:  Press this button to power the MPK261 on or off. \n4. Kensington Lock:  You may use this Kensington lock slot to secure the MPK261 to a \ntable or other surface. \n5. USB Port: Use a standard USB cable to connect this USB port to your computer. The \ncomputer's USB port provides ample power to MPK261. You can also power MPK261 by \nconnecting this USB port to a power outlet using a standard USB charger (sold \nseparately). This connection is also used to send and receive MIDI data to and from your \ncomputer. \nThis connection is also  relevant to MPK261's MIDI Out  and MIDI In : \n\u2022 If an external device is connected to the MIDI Out , your computer can send MIDI \nmessages out along this path: Computer \uf0c6 MPK261 \uf0c6 External Device . \n\u2022 If an external device is connected to the MIDI In , the external device sends MIDI \nmessages in along this path: External Device \uf0c6 MPK261 \uf0c6 Computer . MIDI \nmessages can then be sent to an external device via the MIDI Out, but it must pass \nthrough the computer first. \n6. MIDI Out: Use a standard five-pin MIDI cable to co nnect this MIDI Out to the MIDI In of \nan external MIDI device (e.g., a synthesizer, sequencer, drum machine, etc.). 12\n34\n567899\n \n 35  \n  \n7. MIDI In: Use a standard five-pin MIDI cable to connect this MIDI In to the MIDI Out of an \nexternal MIDI device (e.g., another MIDI controller). The MIDI messages sent to this MIDI In will be sent to your computer via the USB port. \n8. Expression Pedal Input: Connect an optional 1/4\" TRS expr ession pedal to this input.  \n9. Footswitch Input: Connect an optional 1/4\" TS sustain pedal or footswitch to this input. \n(You can configure the connected pedal to control the keyboard's sustain, to send a MIDI CC message, or other messages.) \n \n \n 36  \n  \nAppendix \n \nMode Parameters \n \nEdit Mode \n \nTo edit a control's parameters, press Edit then move or press that control.  \n \nControl  Parameter Settings \nKeyboard MIDI Channel \nOctave Transpose MIDI to DIN Aftertouch Split Common, USB A1\u2013A16, USB B1\u2013B16 \n-3 to +3 -36 to +36 On, Off On, Off \nOn, Off (If set to  On: Split Note  000\u2013060;

USB Port:  Use a standard USB cable to connect this USB port to your computer. The \ncomputer\u2019s USB port provides ample power to  MPD226. If you connect it to a USB hub, \nmake sure it is a powered hub. This connection is also used to send and receive MIDI \ndata to and from your computer. \nYou can also power MPD226 by connecting this USB port to a power outlet using a \nstandard USB charger (sold separately). If you do this, set any relevant controls to send \ntheir MIDI messages out of the MIDI Out . Any controls set to transmit only over the USB \nPort will not be sent to a device connected to the MIDI Out . \nWhen using MPD226 with external MIDI equipment: \n\u2022 If an external device is connected to the MIDI Out , your computer can send MIDI \nmessages out along this path: Computer  \uf0c6 MPD226  \uf0c6 External Device . \n\u2022 If an external device is connected to the MIDI In , the external device sends MIDI \nmessages in along this path: External Device  \uf0c6 MPD226  \uf0c6 Computer . MIDI \nmessages can then be sent to an external device via the MIDI Out, but they must \npass through the computer first. \n2. Power Input:  Connect this power input to a power outlet using an optional power \nadapter (6V DC, 1A, center-positive, sold separately). Alternatively, if you want to use MPD226 to control an external  MIDI device and without a computer connection, you can \nconnect MPD226\u2019s USB Port  to a power outlet using a standard USB charger (sold \nseparately). \n \n \n5 \n  \n3. Power Button:  Press this button to power MPD226 on or off. \n4. MIDI Out:  Use the included 1/8\u201d-to-MIDI adapter and a standard five-pin MIDI cable to \nconnect this MIDI Out to the MI DI In of an external MIDI device (e.g., a synthesizer, \nsequencer, drum machine, etc.). Please see the above USB Port  description for \ninformation about how MIDI message s are routed while using MPD226. \nImportant:  Do not  connect audio devices (e.g., headphones, monitors, etc.) to this jack. \nUse the included 1/8\u201d-to-MIDI adapter to connect MIDI devices only. \n5. MIDI In: Use the included 1/8\u201d-to-MIDI adapter and a standard five-pin MIDI cable to \nconnect this MIDI In to the MIDI Out of an external MIDI device (e.g., another MIDI \ncontroller). The MIDI messages sent to this MIDI In will be sent to your computer via the \nUSB port. Please see the above USB Port  description for information about how MIDI \nmessages are routed while using MPD226. \nImportant:  Do not  connect audio devices (e.g., headphones, monitors, etc.) to this jack. \nUse the included 1/8\u201d-to-MIDI adapter to connect MIDI devices only. \n6. Kensington\u00ae Lock:  You may use this Kensington lock slot to secure the MPD226 to a \ntable or other surface. \n7. Display:  Use this display to view MPD226\u2019s menu s, options, parameters, and settings. \n8.

Press the flashing switch ag ain to return to the normal time division. \n16. Control Bank (Ctrl Bank):  Use this button to select one of three independent banks of \npotentiometers , faders , and switches . This lets you contro l up to 36 independent \nparameters. \n \n \n6 \n  \n17. Pads:  Use these pads to trigger dr um hits or other samples in your software or external \nMIDI sound module. The pads are pressure- and velocity-sensitive, which makes them \nvery responsive and intuitive to play. \n18. Pad Bank:  Use this button to select one of four independent banks of pads. This lets you \naccess up to 64 different pads (16 pads across  4 pad banks). \n19. Full Level:  Press this button to activate Full Level Mode in which the pads always play at \na maximum velocity ( 127), no matter how hard or soft you hit them. \n20. 16 Level:  Press this button to activate/deactivate 16 Level. When activated, the last pad \nthat was hit will be temporarily copied to all 16 pads. The pads will now output the same note number as the initial pad but at fixed velocity values  that increase as the pad \nnumbers increase (e.g., Pad 1 is the minimum, Pad 16 is the maximum), regardless of how hard you hit them. \n21. Note Repeat:  Press and hold this button while st riking a pad to cause the pad to \nretrigger at a rate based on the current tempo and Time Division settings.  \nTip: You can sync Note Repeat to an internal or external MIDI clock source. \n22. Tap Tempo:  Press this button in time with the desired tempo to enter a new tempo (in \nBPM). This will affect the speed of the Note Repeat feature. \nNote:  This button is disabled if Note Repeat is synced to an external MIDI clock source. \n23. Time Div:  Press this button, and then press one of the four switches  above it to select \nthe time division of the Note Repeat feature: quarter notes ( 1/4), eighth notes (1/8 ), 16th \nnotes ( 1/16), or 32nd notes (1/32). Press a lit switch to select a triplet-based time division \n(the switch will flash). Press the flashing switch again to return to the normal time division. \nWhile this button is lit, the switches  will not send any of their normal MIDI messages.  \n24. Transport Buttons: These three buttons are dedicated buttons for sending conventional transport control commands: Stop, Play, and Record . These can be set to send MIDI \n(Start/Stop), pre-assigned MIDI CC values, MMC (MIDI Machine Control), and MMC/MIDI \nSysEx. The PTEX  setting is for use with Avid\n\u00ae Pro Tools\u00ae Express only. \n \n \n7 \n  \nOperation \n \nMPD226 has three diff erent modes of operation. Each mode  can be accessed by pressing the \ncorresponding button on MPD226.  \n In each page of each mode: \n\u2022 Use the up/down Cursors to move between settings on the current page. \n\u2022 Use the left/right Cursors to move between different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Data Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting.  \n Following is a short description of each mode. Each mode is described in detail in its \ncorresponding section later in this User Guide . \n \nPreset Mode:  This mode allows you to load your stored Programs. A Program is a collection \nof information about how the controls (pads, faders, etc.) will behave. Their behavior can be adjusted in Edit Mode then stored. Using Programs allows you to save different \nconfigurations, which can be quickly loaded when you need them, without having to \nreprogram MPD226 every time. See the Preset Mode  section to learn more. \n \nEdit Mode:  This mode allows you to  edit the configuration of  MPD226. Edit Mode is a \npowerful tool for customizing your set-up. In  this mode, you can make changes to how the \npads, faders and other features behave. For example, you may want a fader to transmit only a \nlimited range of MIDI data, or you may want the pads to transmit on a different MIDI channel \nfrom the faders. You can change these and other various parameters in Edit Mode. See the \nEdit Mode  section to learn more. \n \nGlobal Mode:  This mode allows you to set global parameters and make general changes to \nhow MPD226 functions. For example, you can se t the brightness of the display, the MIDI \ncommon channel, MIDI clock settings, the pads\u2019 velocity curve and sensitivity, and more. See \nthe Global Mode  section to learn more. \n \n \nPreset Mode \n Preset Mode allows you to select and load  a Program. MPD226 has se veral default Programs \nwe created to work specifically with some popular DAWs or plug-ins, but you may also \ncreate/edit, store, and load your own Programs. \n \nTo select/load a Program: \n1. Press Preset . (Each time MPD226 is first powered on, it will automatically be in Program \nMode.) The display  will show the current Program name (flashing).  \n2.

Press the Data Dial  to load the desired Program. \n \nTo edit a program,  please refer to the Edit Mode  section. \n \n \n8 \n  \nTo store your new settings in a Program: \nImportant:  Without storing your edited settings, your changes will be lost if you load a new \nProgram. \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Press the Right Cursor  to enter the Store Program  page. \n3. Use the up/down Cursors  to select either the Save To  or Name  field: \n\u2022 Save To:  Turn the Data Dial  to select the Preset to which you want to store your new \nsettings (this will overwrite that Preset). \n\u2022 Name:  Turn the Data Dial  to select the current character. Use the left/right Cursors  \nto move to the previous/next character. \n4. Press the Data Dial  to store the Preset. Your settings will be saved to the new Preset and \nthe display will automatically return to the normal Preset Mode. \n \n \nEdit Mode \n \n1. To enter Edit Mode, press Edit. \n2. Select a control to edit by to uching, pressing, or manipulati ng the desired control (fader, \npad, etc.). In the display , the name of the selected control will appear in the upper left \ncorner, and the editable parameters will be shown below it.  \nIn each page of Edit Mode: \n\u2022 Use the up/down Cursors  to move through the parame ters on the current page. \n\u2022 If there are multiple pages (indicated by Pg1, Pg2, etc.), use the left/right Cursors  to \nmove between different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Data Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. Any value/setting is \nautomatically selected; you do not have to press the Data Dial  to enter or select it.  \n3.

Each mode ca n be accessed by  pressing the \ncorresponding button on MPD232.  \n In each page of each mode: \n\u2022 Use the up/down Cursors to move between settings on the current page. \n\u2022 Use the left/right Cursors to move between different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Data Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting.  \n \nEach mode is described in detail in its corresponding section later in this User Guide : \n\u2022 Preset Mode:  This mode allows you to load your stored Programs. A Program is a \ncollection of information about how the controls (pads, faders, etc.) will behave. Their \nbehavior can be adjusted in Edit Mode then stored. Using Programs allows you to save \ndifferent configurations, which can be quic kly loaded when you need them, without \nhaving to reprogram MP D232 every time. See the Preset Mode  section to learn more. \n\u2022 Edit Mode:  This mode allows you to edit the co nfiguration of MPD232.  Edit Mode is a \npowerful tool for customizing your set-up. In this mode, you can make changes to how \nthe pads, faders and other features behave. For example, you may want a fader to \ntransmit only a limited range of MIDI data, or you may want the pads to transmit on a different MIDI channel from the faders. You can change these and other various \nparameters in Edit Mode. See the Edit Mode  section to learn more. \n\u2022 Global Mode:  This mode allows you to set global parameters and make general changes \nto how MPD232 functions. For example, you can set the brightness of the display, the \nMIDI common channel, MIDI clock settings, the pads\u2019 velocity curve and sensitivity, and \nmore. See the Global Mode  section to learn more. \n \nMPD232 also has a powerful step sequencer , letting you create, edit, and play sequences \nquickly and easily. See the Sequencer  section to learn more. \n \n \nPreset Mode \n Preset Mode allows you to select and load  a Program. MPD232 has se veral default Programs \nwe created to work specifically with some popular DAWs or plug-ins, but you may also \ncreate/edit, store, and load your own Programs. \n \nTo select/load a Program: \n1. Press Preset . (Each time MPD232 is first powered on, it will automatically be in Program \nMode.) The display  will show the current Program name (flashing).  \n2.

Press the Data Dial  to load the desired Program. \n To edit a program,  please refer to the Edit Mode  section. \n \n \n8 \n  \nTo store your new settings in a Program: \nImportant:  Without storing your edited settings, your changes will be lost if you load a new \nProgram. \n1. Press Preset  to enter Preset Mode. \n2. Press the Right Cursor  to enter the Store Program  page. \n3. Use the up/down Cursors  to select either the Save To  or Name  field: \n\u2022 Save To:  Turn the Data Dial  to select the Preset to which you want to store your new \nsettings (this will overwrite that Preset). \n\u2022 Name:  Turn the Data Dial  to select the current character. Use the left/right Cursors  \nto move to the previous/next character. \n4. Press the Data Dial  to store the Preset. Your settings will be saved to the new Preset and \nthe display will automatically return to the normal Preset Mode. \n \n \nEdit Mode \n \n1. To enter Edit Mode, press Edit. \n2. Select a control to edit by to uching, pressing, or manipulati ng the desired control (fader, \npad, etc.). In the display , the name of the selected control will appear in the upper left \ncorner, and the editable parameters will be shown below it.  \nIn each page of Edit Mode: \n\u2022 Use the up/down Cursors  to move through the parame ters on the current page. \n\u2022 If there are multiple pages (indicated by Pg1, Pg2, etc.), use the left/right Cursors  to \nmove between different pages. \n\u2022 Turn the Data Dial  to change the currently selected value/setting. Any value/setting is \nautomatically selected; you do not have to press the Data Dial  to enter or select it.  \n3.

After \nRestoring  flashes on the display, the factory/default settings have been restored. \n \n \nOS \nVersion:  MPD232\u2019s current operating system information. \nBoot ROM:  MPD232\u2019s current ROM read-only memory information. \n \n \n \n14 \n  \nSequencer \n \nMPD232 has a powerful step sequ encer, letting you cr eate, edit, and play sequences quickly \nand easily. A sequence  is, essentially, a pattern that you can use as part of a song. Some \nsongs may use only one sequence while others may use several sequences in a complex song \nstructure. MPD232\u2019s sequences may be up to 32 steps long. Each step is a \u201cnote event\u201d (a \nMIDI Note On message). \nBefore creating a sequence, you may want to determine two important aspects of how it will \nsound: its length (see Steps  below) and its timing settings (see  Timing  below). \nThe most intuitive way to create  a sequence is to record it  in real time with MPD232\u2019s pads \n(see Recording ), but you may also want to work more precisely and fine-tune it using the step \nbuttons  and Sequence Edit Mode (see  Editing ). \n \nSteps  \nThe subdivisions of a sequence are represented by 32 \u201csteps\u201d by the step buttons , 16 at a \ntime. The step buttons show the steps for one pad at a time, indicated in the display. You can \npress the step buttons to quickly add or re move note events to or from a sequence. \n \nTo set the number of steps in a sequence: \n1. Press Edit to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Press the Step Bank  button. Sequence Edit  will appear at the top of the display . \n3. Use the Up/Down  Cursors  to select Steps . \n4. Turn the Data Dial  to change the number of steps. The available range is 01\u201332. \nIn this window, you can also set what commands the sequencer uses to start or stop \nplayback as well as how the step buttons show the sequence during playback. See  \nEdit Mode > Sequence Edit (Step Bank)  to learn more.  \n \n \nTiming \nMPD232\u2019s sequencer uses four timing settings: tempo , time division , swing , and gate. These \nsettings are saved in the Program. They affect th e Note Repeat feature as well as the sequencer. \nImportant:  This setting is for MPD232\u2019s internal sequ encer, which can be used to send MIDI \nClock to external MIDI devices and/or some DAWs that support it. Similarly, if you want \nMPD232 to follow your DAW\u2019s tempo, set your DA W to use its own MIDI Clock (if applicable)  \nand set MPD232 to receive it. See Global Mode > Clock  to learn how to do this. \n \nTo set the timing settings: \n1. Press Edit to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Press Tap Tempo . Tempo  will appear at the top of the display . \n3. Use the Up/Down Cursors  to select any of the four fields, and turn the Data Dial  to adjust \nthe value or setting:  \n\u2022 BPM:  The tempo as indicated in beats per minute. The available range is 30\u2013300 BPM. \n\u2022 Time Division:  The speed of the Note Repeat repetition as a division of the master \ntempo or external clock. The available options are 1/4, 1/4T , 1/8, 1/8T , 1/16, 1/16T , \n1/32, and 1/32T . (T denotes a triplet-based time division.) \nImportant: The time division affects how swing is applied. The time division does not \naffect the number of steps. \n \n \n15 \n  \n\u2022 Gate:  The length of the note events of the sequence, shown as a percentage of the \ncurrent time division setting. The available range is 00%  (very short and staccato -\nsounding; certain devices may not respond to notes this short) to 99%  (longer and \nlegato -sounding). The default setting is 50% . \n\u2022 Swing:  The amount of swing\u2014a \u201cshuffle\u201d or triplet-based feel\u2014that is applied to the \nsequence. The available range is 50%  (no swing, the default setting) to 75%  \n(completely swung). \nImportant:  The swing setting is affected by the time division. Furthermore, if your time \ndivision is triplet-based, swing will not be applied.  \n  \nRecording \nTo record a sequence in real time: \n1. Press Seq Rec . The sequencer will start recording immediately and Seq On/Off  will be lit. \nIf you used Edit Mode to change the button or message that starts the sequencer\u2019s \nplayback ( Play or MIDI Start ), the sequencer will not start recording until you press Play \nor send it a MIDI Start  message. \n2. Press the pads  to record their note events and velocities as steps in the sequence. You \ncan play and record multiple pads simultaneously. The step buttons will show the note \nevents for the last pad you pressed. \nThe sequence will loop until you stop it. As it loops, if you record a note event over an \nexisting one for the same pad, the new note event will replace the old one. Otherwise, your \npreviously recorded note events will remain in the sequence. \n3. Press Seq Rec  to stop recording. \n4. Press Seq On/Off  to stop playback. \nIf you used Edit Mode to change the button or message that stops the sequencer\u2019s \nplayback ( Stop  or MIDI Stop ), the sequencer will not stop recording until you press Stop  \nor send it a MIDI Stop  message. \n \n \nEditing \nYou can edit a sequence while it is playing or stopped. You can do this by using the pads  and \nstep buttons  or by using just the display , Cursors , and Data Dial . \n To enter or erase note events in a sequence using the pads and step buttons: \n1. Press Seq Edit  to enter Sequence Edit Mode. \n2. Press the pad whose note events you want to edit. The current pad number will appear next \nto Track  in the display , and any note events for th at pad will appear in the step buttons . \nThe current pad will be lit green  when it has a note event on the current step or red when \nthe current step is empty. The other pads will be lit amber  when they have note events on \nthe current step or blue when the current step is empty. \n3. To add a note event for that pad, press an unlit step button .  \nTo erase a note event for that pad, press a lit  step button . \n4. To add or erase note events fo r another pad, repeat Steps 2 \u20133. \n \n \n16 \n  \nTo enter or erase note events in a sequence using only the display, Cursors, and Data Dial: \n1. Press Seq Edit  to enter Sequence Edit Mode. \n2. The display  will show the following fields: \n\u2022 Track:  The number of the pad whose note events are shown below.  \n\u2022 Step:  The previous, current, and next step numbers.  \n\u2022 Play:  An asterisk ( * ) indicates that step contains a note event for that pad. If there \nis no note event, the field will be blank. \n\u2022 Velo:  The note event\u2019s velocity ( 1\u2013127). If there is no note event, the field will show ---. \nUse these controls to navigate the display and edit your sequence: \n\u2022 Use Left/Right Cursors  to select the desired step (which is always shown as the \nmiddle one). \n\u2022 Use the Up/Down Cursors  to select the desired field. \n\u2022 Turn the Data Dial  to change a value or setting. \n \n \nTo erase all note events for a pad or for all pads in the sequence: \n1. Press Edit to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Press Seq Rec . Sequence Edit will appear at the top of the display . \n3. Turn the Data Dial  to select the desired pad number ( 01\u201364) or All (to erase the entire \nsequence). \n4. Press the Data Dial  to confirm your choice. Be careful\u2014this can\u2019t be undone!   \n \n \nTo edit velocities of note events: \n1. Press Seq Edit  to enter Sequence Edit Mode. \n2. Press the pad whose velocities you want to edit. The current pad number will appear next \nto Track  in the display , and any note events for that pad will appear in the step buttons . \nThe current pad will be lit green  when it has a note event on the current step or red when \nthe current step is empty. The other pads will be lit amber  when they have note events on \nthe current step or blue when the current step is empty. \n3. Use the Left/Right  Cursors  to select the desired step, shown in the Step  field in the display . \n4. Use the Down  Cursor  to select the Velo field (if it\u2019s not selected already), and then turn \nthe Data Dial  to adjust the velocity. The available range is 1\u2013127. \n5.

Eine Sequenz  ist im \nWesentlichen ein Muster, das Sie als Teil eines Songs verwenden k\u00f6nnen. Einige Songs k\u00f6nnen nur \neine Sequenz verwenden, w\u00e4hren d andere mehrere Sequ enzen in einer komplexen Songstruktur \nverwenden. Die Sequenzen des MPD232 k\u00f6nnen bi s zu 32 Steps lang se in. Jeder Step ist ein \n\u201eNoten-Event\u201c (eine MIDI-Note-On-Meldung). \nBevor Sie eine Sequenz erstellen,  sollten Sie zwei wichtige musika lische Aspekte festlegen: ihre \nL\u00e4nge (siehe Steps  unten) und ihre Timing-Einstellungen (siehe Timing  weiter unten). \nDie intuitivste Methode eine Sequ enz zu erstellen, ist eine Ec htzeitaufnahme mit den MPD232- Pads  \n(siehe Aufnahme ), Sie k\u00f6nnen jedoch auch genauer arbeiten und mit den Step-Tasten  und dem \nSequence-Bearbeitungsmodus feineinstellen (siehe Bearbeiten ). \n \nSteps  \nDie Unterteilungen einer Sequenz (jewe ils 16) werden in 32 \u201eSteps\u201c mit den Step-Tasten  dargestellt. \nDie Step-Tasten zeigen die Steps f\u00fcr jeweils ein Pa d, was am Display zu se hen ist.

Der verf\u00fcgbare Bereich ist 01 - 32. \nIn diesem Fenster k\u00f6nnen Sie auch festlegen, welche Be fehle der Sequenzer zum Starten oder \nStoppen der Wiedergabe verwendet und wie di e Step-Tasten den Ablauf w\u00e4hrend der \nWiedergabe anzeigen. Siehe Bearbeitungsmodus > Sequence bearbeiten (Step-Bank) , um \nmehr zu erfahren. \n \nTiming \nDer Sequenzer des MPD232 verwendet vier Timing-Einstellungen: Tempo , Zeiteinteilung, Swing  und \nGate  Diese Einstellungen werden im Programm ges peichert. Sie beeinflussen die Funktion Note \nWiederholen sowie den Sequenzer. \nWichtig:  Diese Einstellung ist f\u00fcr de n internen Sequenzer des MPD2 32, der benutzt werden kann, \num MIDI-Clock an externe MIDI-G er\u00e4te und/oder einige DAWs zu se nden, die unters t\u00fctzt werden. \nUnd falls Sie m\u00f6chten, dass Ihr MP D232 dem Tempo Ihrer DAW folgt, dann stellen Sie Ihre DAW auf \ndie Verwendung ihrer eigenen Clock ein (falls  vorhanden) und stellen das MPD232 auf Empfang. \nSiehe Global-Modus > Clock , um dies zu lernen. \n \nZum Anpassen der Zeiteinstellungen: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Bearbeiten (Edit) , um in den Bearbeitungsmodus zu gelangen. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie Tap-Tempo . Tempo  erscheint im obersten Bereich des Displays . \n3.

(T bezeichnet eine triolenbasierte Zeiteinteilung.) \nWichtig: Die Zeiteinteilung beeinfluss t, wie Swing angewendet wi rd. Die Zeiteinteilung hat \nkeinen  Einfluss auf die Anzahl der Steps. \n \n \n71 \n  \n\u2022 Gate:  Die L\u00e4nge der Notenereignisse in der S equenz, die als Prozen tsatz der aktuellen \nZeiteinteilungseinstellung an gezeigt werden. Der Einstell bereich erstreckt sich von 00%  (sehr \nkurz und \u00e4hnlich einem Stakkato ; bestimmte Ger\u00e4te reagieren nicht auf so kurze Noten) bis \n99% (l\u00e4nger und eher legato ). Die Standardei nstellung ist 50% . \n\u2022 Swing:  Der Swing-Anteil - ein \u201eShuffle\u201c oder tr iolenbasierter Takt, der auf die Sequenz \nangewendet wird. Der Ei nstellbereich geht von 50%  (kein Swing, die St andardeinstellung) bis \n75%  (kompletter Swing).  \nWichtig:  Die Swing-Einstellung wir d von der Zeiteinteilung  beeinflusst. Wenn Ihre \nZeiteinteilung auf Triolen basiert, wird  kein Swing angewendet werden.  \n \n \nAufnahme \nSo nehmen Sie eine Sequenz in Echtzeit auf: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Seq Rec . Der Sequencer wird die Aufnahme sofort starten und Seq Ein/Aus  wird \nleuchten. \nWenn Sie den Bearbeitungsmodus verwendet haben, um die Taste oder Nachrich t zu \u00e4ndern, \ndie die Wiedergabe des S equenzers startet ( Wiedergabe  oder MIDI Start ), wird der Sequenzer \nerst aufnehmen, wenn Sie Wiedergabe  dr\u00fccken oder eine MIDI Start -Nachricht senden. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie Pads , um ihre Noten-Events und Geschwin digkeiten als Steps in die Sequenz \naufzunehmen. Sie k\u00f6nnen mehreren Pads gleichzei tig spielen und aufnehmen. Die Step-Tasten \nwerden die Noten-Even ts f\u00fcr das zuletzt gedr\u00fcckte Pad zeigen. \nDie Sequenz wird im Loop laufen, bis Sie sie ausschalten. Wenn Sie im Loop ein Noten-Event \n\u00fcber ein bestehendes Ev ent f\u00fcr das gleiche Pad aufnehmen, wird das neue Note n-Event das alte \nersetzen. Andernfalls bleiben di e zuvor aufgezeichneten Noten-Ev ents in der Sequenz erhalten. \n3. Dr\u00fccken Sie Seq Rec , um die Aufnahme zu stoppen. \n4. Dr\u00fccken Sie Seq Ein/Aus , um die Wiedergabe zu stoppen. \nWenn Sie den Bearbeitungsmodus verwendet haben, um die Taste oder Nachrich t zu \u00e4ndern, \ndie die Wiedergabe des S equenzers stoppt ( Stopp  oder MIDI Stopp ), wird der Sequenzer die \nAufnahme erst st oppen, wenn Sie Stopp  dr\u00fccken oder eine MIDI Stopp -Nachricht senden. \n \n \nBearbeitung \nSie k\u00f6nnen eine Sequenz bearbeiten, w\u00e4hrend si e abgespielt oder gest oppt wird. Sie k\u00f6nnen  dies tun, \nindem Sie die Pads  und Step-Buttons  oder das Display , Cursors  und das Datenrad  verwenden. \n \nZur Eingabe oder zum L\u00f6schen von Noten-Events in einer Sequenz mit den Pads und Step-Tasten: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Seq Bearbeiten , um in den Sequence-Edit-Modus zu gelangen. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie das Pad, dessen Noten-Events Sie bearbeiten m\u00f6chten.

To get the \nmost out of this chapter, we recommend reproducing each of the described steps in order. \n To start using APC64 with Ableton Live, first make sure you have downloaded and installed the latest version of \nAbleton Live (11 or newer). \n Connect your APC64 hardware to your computer running Ableton Live using one of the included USB-C cables, \nand set the Power Switch to On. By default, APC64 will power on in Able ton Live Device Mode. If you are having \nissues connecting to Ableton Live, make sure this setting has not been changed in the Global Menu . \n Ensure that APC64 has been selected as a Control Surfac e and MIDI Input and Output source in Ableton Live\u2019s \nPreferences, as described in 2.0 Setup . \n APC64 will begin with SESSION VIEW in focus. This display mode gives you an overview of your project, which \nis represented by a red outline in Ableton Live. Use the cursor buttons to move the current view of the pad grid  \nby one row or column at a time. \n Each column in Session View represents a track . Tracks can be used to hold audio samples, drum kits, instrument \nplugins and more. Use the TRACK SELECT buttons to select the track in focus.  \n \n \nSession View in Ableton Live, showing MIDI and Audio trac ks (left side) and Send and Master tracks (right side) \n \n \nTrack Select Buttons on APC64   \n\n \n \n13 \n  \nEach track is made up of clips , which are short sequences of audio or MIDI. Only one clip in a track can play at a \ntime. When a pad has a clip loaded to it, press it to launc h it. Let\u2019s start by adding a sample from Ableton Live\u2019s \nlibrary to a track and launching it. \n1. Use the Ableton Live Browser to find a sound from the Samples Category.  \n2. Add this to an available Audio Track in the first clip slot. \n3. Once the clip has been loaded, you will see the corresponding pad on APC64 light up. \n4. Press the pad to launch the clip. You will hear the sample playing, the PLAY button will light up, and the pad \nwill begin pulsing green to indicate playback is active.  \n5. To stop playback of the project, press the STOP button. The pad will continue to pulse green, meaning it will \nrelaunch once playback is resumed. To stop clip playback, press the CLIP STOP button, and then press the \nTRACK SELECT button for the track containing the audio clip. \n \n  \n \n Clips that are aligned in the same row are called a scene . You can trigger clips in a scene at the same time by \npressing the LAUNCH button on the right side of the row. Let\u2019s try loading another clip to another Audio Track.  \n1. Use the Ableton Live Browser to find another sound from the Samples Category.  \n2. Add this clip to a second Audio Track in the same clip row as your first sample. \n3. Press the row 1 LAUNCH button to launch both clips at the same time. Now both pads will pulse green and \nboth samples will play.   \n4. To stop both clips from playing at the same time, press and hold SHIFT and then press the row 8 LAUNCH / \nSTOP ALL button.  \n \n  \n  \nA clip added in Session View. \nTwo clips launched together. \nPress SHIFT+STOP ALL to stop both clips. \n \n \n14 \n  \nIn addition to loading audio samples, you can create your  own clips using MIDI instruments. Let\u2019s start a new clip \nrecording. We\u2019ll begin by adding and recording a drum track. \n1. Use the Ableton Live Browser to load a kit from the Drums Category. Add this to an available MIDI track. \n2. Press the NOTE MODE button, and then select the MIDI track using the TRACK SELECT button. \nAPC64\u2019s pad grid will change, and the bottom-left quadrant of pa ds will be lit. You can now use these pads \nlike a traditional 4x4 drum pad layout to play samples.  \n3. When a MIDI track is selected from APC64, the selected track\u2019s track arm button in Ableton Live will turn light \nred to indicate it has been automatically record-arme d. This allows you to immediately play the pads and \nhear the sample playback. \nYou can also manually arm the track for recording by pressing RECORD ARM button on APC64, and then \npressing the Control Row  button for the MIDI track. The track arm  button in Ableton Live will then be lit \nbright red to indicate the track is armed, and it will stay armed even if you navigate away from the track. \n4. Press the encoder to enable the metronome while you record. \n5. Press the RECORD transport button. A new clip will be created on the track and begin recording immediately. \n6. Tap out a drum pattern on the pads to record it. \n7. When you are finished, you can press RECORD again and the clip will begin playback. You can edit the clip \nin Ableton Live as needed. \n \n  \n \n   \n  \n  \nNote Mode for a Drum Track. \nArming the track for recording. \nPlaying back the recorded clip. \n \n \n15 \n  \nNext, let\u2019s continue to build out the track by adding a melodic bass line. \n1. Use the Ableton Live Browser to load a bass melodic instrument from the Instruments Category. Add this to \na second MIDI track.  \n2. Press the NOTE MODE button, and then select the MIDI track using the TRACK SELECT button. APC64\u2019s pad \ngrid will change to a melodic note layout. The root notes will be lit according to the track color.  \n3. Press NOTE MODE a second time to configure the Note Mode settings. Use the pads or the encoder to \nadjust the root note, scale, and pad layout as needed. Press NOTE MODE a second time to return to the \nmelodic pad layout.  \n4. Once you are ready to record, ensure that the tr ack is armed for recording, and then press the RECORD \ntransport button. A new clip will be created on  the track and begin recording immediately. \n5. Tap out a bass line on the pads to record it. \n6. When you are finished, you can press RECORD again and the clip will begin playback. You can edit the clip \nin Ableton Live as needed.   \n \n  \n \n  \n  \nNote Mode for a Melodic Track. \n \n \n16 \n  \nFinally, let\u2019s add harmonic chor ds to tie everything together. \n1. Insert a new MIDI track into your  Ableton Live project as needed. \n2. Use the Ableton Live Browser to load a harm onic instrument like a synth pad from the Instruments Category. \nAdd this to a third MIDI track.  \n3. Press the CHORD MODE button, and then select the MIDI track using the TRACK SELECT button. APC64\u2019s \npad grid will change to the same melodic note layout as Note Mode, but this time each pad plays multiple \nnotes simultaneously to create a chord.  \n4. Press CHORD MODE a second time to configure the Chord Mode settings. The Chord Mode configuration \nshares its scale and mode settings with Note Mode co nfiguration to ensure your tracks are harmonically \nsynced. Use the pads or the encoder to adjust the chord type as needed. Press CHORD MODE a second \ntime to return to the melodic pad layout.  \n5. Once you are ready to record, ensure that the tr ack is armed for recording, and then press the RECORD \ntransport button. A new clip will be created on  the track and begin recording immediately. \n6. Tap out a chord progression on the pads to record it. \n7. When you are finished, you can press RECORD again and the clip will begin playback. You can edit the clip \nin Ableton Live as needed. \n \n  \n \n These steps give you the basic building blocks to launch cl ips and create clips in Ableton Live using your APC64. \nTry recording a few more clips with variations, and then experiment with launching different clips or scenes.  \n \n  \nChord Mode. \n \n \n17 \n  \nAs you play your project, you can also begin using APC64 for editing and mixing using other controls on the \ndevice. Try using the Touch Fader Controls for hands-on adjustments to various track parameters: \n1. By default, the touch strips will be set to DEVICE control, with this button lit on APC64. \n2. Select a track with a MIDI device or effect using the TRACK SELECT buttons. \n3. Try adjusting one of the touch faders. The device parameter being adjusted will be shown in APC64\u2019s display , \nand you will see the parameter being adjusted in Ableton Live. \n \n  \n \n \nYou can change the active Touch Fader Control by pressing the VOLUME , PAN , SEND , or CHANNEL STRIP \nbuttons. Try selecting another control and making further adjustments, like turning the track volume up or down or adjusting a track\u2019s Send  control to add an effect. \n For an in-depth review of APC64\u2019s features and functions, proceed to the following 5.0 Operation chapter.  \n \n \n \n  \nDevice control mode for the Touch Faders. \n \n \n18 \n  \n5.0 Operation \n \nThis chapter describes APC64\u2019s functions.

The selected track\u2019s button will be lit white. The display \nwill also show the track name (highlighted by the track color), device name (if one is loaded), and current device bank (if a device is loaded). \n \nTrack Name \nDevice Name \nDevice Bank \n \n \n \nThe eight rows of APC64\u2019s pad grid correspond to eight scenes of clips. See 5.1.2 Launching Clips  for more \ninformation on launching clips and scenes. \n As your project grows, you may have more tracks and scenes than can \nbe shown on the pad grid.  \nTo move the 8x8 focus by one track or scene at a time, press \nthe cursor keys . As you move, the red outline will also move in \nAbleton Live\u2019s Session View.  \nTo move the 8x8 focus by eight tracks or scenes at a time, \npress and hold SHIFT and press the cursor keys .  \n \n \n  \n \n \n20 \n  \n5.1.1 Overview Mode \n \nIn very large projects, you may have more th an the eight tracks and eight scenes that \nare immediately visible on APC64\u2019s pad grid while in Session View. Although you \ncan move the current 8x8 focus in Session View using the cursors , Overview mode \nprovides another way to quickly and easily navigate between large amounts of tracks \nand scenes and give a snapshot of the current clip statuses. \nTo open Overview mode,  press SESSION VIEW / OVERVIEW while in Session \nView. Alternatively, press and hold SESSION VIEW / OVERVIEW while in \nSession View to temporarily view Overview mode. When you release the button, the pad grid will return to Session View. \n In Overview mode, each pad on the pad grid (starting in the upper-left corner) \nrepresents a block of eight tracks and eight scenes in your session. This is represented \nby the red outline in Ableton Live.  \nTo move between 8x8 blocks, press a lit pad in Overview mode. The number of \npads available will depend on the size of your project.  \n For instance, in the image to the right, you could press the pads to access the following: \nPad 1 (amber) : Tracks 1\u20138, Scenes 1\u20138 \nPad 2 (red) : Tracks 9\u201316, Scenes 1\u20138 \nPad 3 (green) : Tracks 1\u20138, Scenes 9\u201316 \n The pads in Overview mode will also change color depending on the the current 8x8 \nblock in focus and the behavior of clips in each block:  \nAmber: The current 8x8 block in focus.  \nGreen: An 8x8 block where clips are currently playing. \nRed: An 8x8 block where no clips are playing. \nOff: Empty 8x8 blocks. \n \n \n  1 2 \n3 \n \n \n21 \n  \n5.1.2 Launching Clips \n \nWhen Session View is active, pressing the pads in the pad grid  will launch a clip if one is loaded. If the clip slot is \nempty, it will stop playback on the selected track, or create a new clip if the track is record-armed. \n To launch a clip, press a pad. Depending on the launch quantization value, the selected \npad will begin flashing green as it prepares to play. Once the clip begins playing, the \npad will slowly pulse green.  \nIf a track is selected and record-enabled, a new clip will be created if there is not one in \nthe selected clip slot. See 5.1.3 Recording Clips  for more information on creating clips. \n  \nTo select a clip without launching it, press and hold SHIFT and then press the pad.  \n  In addition to launching individual clips, you can also launch an entire row of clips (called \na scen e). This is useful for creating distinct song sections where you want several clips to \nbegin playing simultaneously. \nTo launch a scene (or row of clips), use the LAUNCH buttons on the right side of \nthe pad grid.  \n  To stop a clip: 1. Press the CLIP STOP button to set the function of the Control Row . \n2. Press the Control Row button that corresponds with the track of the clip you would \nlike to stop. The Control Row button will begin flashing until the clip stops (depending \non the global launch quantization value). \n   To stop all clips,  press and hold SHIFT and press the Row 8 LAUNCH / STOP ALL \nbutton.  \n \n \n To move the current matrix display view,  use the cursors . Hold SHIFT and use the \ncursors  to move the 8x8 focus by eight rows or columns at a time. The red outline in \nAbleton Live will move accordingly. \n \n  \n2 \n1 \n \n \n22 \n  \n5.1.3 Recording Clips \n \nTo create a new clip:  1. Press the RECORD ARM button, and then press the TRACK SELECT button for the \ntrack where you want to add a clip. \n2. Tap an empty clip slot on the pads. A new clip will be created and begin recording \nimmediately.  \nAlternatively, press the RECORD transport button. A new clip will be created in the \nselected track in the next available clip slot. \n To stop recording, do any of the following: \n\u2022 Press the CONTROL ROW button again while RECORD ARM is still selected. The clip \nwill exit recording and begin playback.   \n\u2022 Press the clip slot pad you are recording to . The clip will exit recording and begin \nplayback. \n\u2022 Press the RECORD transport button. The clip will exit recording and begin playback. \n\u2022 Press the STOP transport button. The clip will exit recording and playback will stop. \n \n \nIn addition to recording a new clip, you can also use MI DI overdub recording to add on to an existing clip. \n To begin MIDI overdub recording:  1. Press and hold SHIFT and press the RECORD transport button.  \n2. Select the track with the clip you wa nt to overdub record onto using the TRACK SELECT buttons. \n3. Launch the desired clip, or press PLAY to begin playback of the clip if it is prepared for launch. \n4. Begin recording. Your new performance will be layere d on top of the existing MIDI data in the clip. \n To stop MIDI overdub recording:  \n\u2022 Press the CONTROL ROW button again while RECORD ARM is still selected. The clip will exit recording and \nbegin playback.   \n\u2022 Press the RECORD transport button. The clip will exit recording and begin playback. \n\u2022 Press the STOP transport button. The clip will exit recording and playback will stop. \n \n  \n1 \n2 \n \n \n23 \n  \n5.1.3.1 Fixed Length \n \nBy default, when you begin recording a clip, it will continue playing and recording until \nthe clip is stopped or transport playback is stopped. However, you can also set a clip to only record for a certain time by using the Fixed Length function. \nTo enable Fixed Length recording,  press the FIXED LENGTH button. When \nenabled, this button will light up. \nTo adjust the Fixed Length value,  press and hold the FIXED LENGTH button. The \nAPC64 display will show \u201cFixed Length\u201d and the current value. Turn the encoder to \nadjust the value, and then release the FIXED LENGTH button to set it.  \n \n \nFixed Length \n1 BAR \n \n  \n  \n \n \n24 \n  \n5.1.4 Quantization \n \nAs you record new clips, your playing may not be perf ectly aligned to a given tempo subdivision. This can be \neasily corrected by using quantization, which will snap no tes (either already recorded or as you record) to the \ntiming grid.  \n Before you apply quantization, set the tempo subdivision that you want your notes to \nalign with.  \nTo adjust the quantization value, press and hold the QUANTIZE button. The \nAPC64 display will show \u201cQuantization\u201d and the current value. Turn the encoder to \nadjust the value, and then release the QUANTIZE  button to set it. \n \n \nQuantization \n1/16 \n   Once your quantization value is set, you can apply it to recorded clips or apply it as you record notes. \nTo apply quantization to a recorded clip, press and hold the QUANTIZE button, and then tap the desired \nclip. The notes in the clip will be shifted to alig n with the closest quantization value subdivision.  \nTo apply quantization as you record,  press and hold SHIFT , and then press the QUANTIZE button. When \npressed, the APC64 display will show \u201cRecord Quantize\u201d and its current status, either On or Off. Set this to \nOn to enable quantization as you record. This will auto matically snap new notes to the closest quantization \nvalue subdivision as you record. When enabled, the QUANTIZE button will be lit while SHIFT is also being \nheld. \nNote: This feature only toggles Record Quantization on an d off. To set the Record Quantization value, use \nthe Edit > Record Quantization  menu option in Ableton Live. \n \n \nRecord Quantize \nOn \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n25 \n  \n5.1.3 Managing Clips \n \nBasic clip editing and management can be done directly from the APC64 hardware using the following controls. \n Use the CLEAR button to erase clips and scenes: \nTo erase a clip, press and hold the CLEAR button, and then press the \ndesired pad.  \nTo erase an entire scene, press and hold the CLEAR button, and then press \nthe LAUNCH button for the desired scene. All clips in that row will be \nremoved. \n Use the DUPLICATE button to copy clips and scenes. \nTo duplicate a clip, press and hold the DUPLICATE button, and then press \nthe desired pad. The clip and all its note and performance data will be copied to the next clip slot below. \nTo duplicate a scene, press and hold the DUPLICATE button, and then \npress the LAUNCH button for the desired scene. All clips in that row will be \ncopied to the next row below.  \nNote: If another clip or scene is in the next clip slot or row, its contents will be \noverwritten by the duplicated clip or scene.   \n To double the length of a clip, press and hold both SHIFT and the DUPLICATE / DOUBLE button, and then \npress the desired pad. The clip\u2019s total length will instantly be doubled. If note or performance data is already recorded into the clip, it will also be doubled to the new length.  \nNote: Audio clips cannot be doubled. \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n \n26 \n  \n5.2 Note Mode and Chord Mode \n \nAPC64 features two modes for playing melodic content from the pad grid. \nIn Note Mode , each pad plays an individual note. In Chord Mode , each pad \nplays a chord comprised of three or more notes in sync. \nTo open Note Mode,  press the NOTE MODE button. \nTo open Chord Mode,  press the CHORD MODE button. \nBoth Note Mode and Chord Mode may be  used in conjunction with Ableton \nLive MIDI tracks, or when using APC64 as a standalone MIDI or CV device. \n \n5.2.1 Configuration \n Both Note Mode and Chord Mode have Configuration op tions which can be accessed  by pressing and holding \nSHIFT and then pressing either NOTE MODE or CHORD MODE . You can also press and hold the NOTE MODE \nor CHORD MODE buttons while viewing either mode to momentarily access the Configuration view. When you \nrelease the button, you will return to the previous mode. \nAlthough they can be accessed separately, the configurat ions of these two modes are identical and the settings \nare shared across both modes to ensure your tracks are harmonically synced. When you press SHIFT and either \nbutton, both buttons will be lit up, and you will see Note/Chord Cfg on the display along with the following pad \nlayout:  \n C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 \nR1  Db Eb  Gb Ab Bb  \nR2 C D E F G A B C \nR3      1-3-5 1-2-5 1-4-5 \nR4 Separate \nRows by 3rd Separate \nRows by 4th Separate \nRows by 5th Separate \nRows by 6th  1-3-5-7 1-3-5-6 1-3-5-9 \nR5 Separate \nRows by 7th Separate \nRows by \nOctave  Show/Hide \nNon-Scale \nNotes  Send Poly \nOn/Off Maj Min Dim \nR6 Chromatic Major Melodic \nMinor Harmonic \nMinor Major \nPentatonic Minor \nPentatonic Dorian Phrygian \nR7 Lydian Mixolydian Aeolian Locrian Blues Flamenco Hungarian Whole Tone \nR8 OCT -2 OCT -1 OCT 0 OCT 1 OCT 2 OCT 3 OCT 4 OCT 5 \n \nIn the example above, the following is selected: \nKey: C \nChord: 1-3-5  \nChord Type:  Major \nLayout: Separate rows by 5th  Non-Scale Notes:  Hidden \nSend Poly Aftertouch:  On \nScale: Major \nOctave:  1 \nSee the following page for descriptions of each parameter.   \n \n \n27 \n  \nUse Rows 1\u20132  to set the root note of the scale. These pads are laid out like the keys of a piano, from C to C in the \nlower row. \nWhen one of these pads is pressed, the selected root note will be lit green. The remaining scale notes will be lit \namber, and any non-scale notes will be lit red. These colo rs will automatically update as you change root notes \nand other scale parameters. \n Use Rows 3\u20135, Columns 6\u20138  to select a chord type. For five- and seve n-tone scales, press one of the Rows 3\u20134 \npads: \n1-3-5 (major/minor) 1-2-5 (sus2) 1-4-5 (sus4) \n1-3-5-7 (major7/minor7) 1-3-5-6 (maj or6/minor6) 1-3-5-9 (major9/minor9) \nFor six- or twelve-tone scales, press one of the Rows 3\u20134 pads and one of the Row 5 pads to change the Alt Chord \nType. \nMajor Minor Diminished \nWhen selected, the chosen chord will play in the set scale each time a pad is pressed while Chord Mode is active. \nThe selected pad will be lit green. \n \nUse Rows 4\u20135, Columns 1\u20134  to determine how notes are laid out on the 8x8 pad grid: \nSeparate Rows by 3rd Separate Rows by 5th Separate Rows by 7th \nSeparate Rows by 4th Separate Rows by 6th Separate Rows by Octave \n \nPress the Show/Hide Non-Scale Notes pad ( R5,C4 ) to enable or disable notes from outside the selected scale \nfrom being shown on the pad grid. Non-scale notes will be unlit in the pad grid when enabled. \n Press the Send Poly Aftertouch  pad ( R5,C5 ) to enable poly aftertouch messages from the pad grid. \n \nUse Rows 6\u20137  to set the scale type: \nChromatic Major Pentatonic Lydian Blues \nMajor Minor Pentatonic Mixolydian Flamenco \nMelodic Minor Dorian Aeolian Hungarian \nHarmonic Minor Phrygian Locrian Whole Tone \n \nUse Row 8  is used to set the base octave for the pads in  Note Mode, starting from the lower-left pad: \nOctave -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 \nLowest Note C-2 C-1 C0 C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 \n \n  \n \n \n28 \n  \nAs an alternative to using the pads to ch ange the note mode, you can also use the encoder to change these \nvalues as shown on the display . Turn the encoder to browse each note mode category. Press the encoder to \nopen it, and then turn the encoder to browse the available options. When you are finished, press the encoder \nagain to confirm your selection. \n \nNote/Chord Cfg \n1. Root Note \n\uf039   C \n \n \n  \n \n \n29 \n  \n5.2.2 Playing Notes and Chords \n \nIn both Note and Chord Modes, root notes of the set scale will \nbe lit according to the color of the selected track, and the remaining scale notes will be lit white. If the configuration has been set to Show Non-Scale Notes , these will be unlit.  \nTo play a note or chord,  press a pad. When pressed, the \nplayed pad will be lit green, and all other pads of the same note value will be lit a lighter shade of green. Notes and Chords are always sent on MIDI Channel 1 in Ableton Live. \nNote: When Note and Chord Modes are active, selecting \na MIDI track from APC64 will automatically arm it so you \ncan immediately play and hear notes. The track arm \nbutton for the selected track in Ableton Live will turn light \nred to indicate it has been automatically armed. \n \n \n5.2.3 Drum Tracks in Note Mode \n \nWhen a drum track is selected in Ableton Live, the appearance \nof Note Mode will automatically adjust to a traditional 4x4 drum pad layout, beginning in th e bottom-left quadrant of the \npad grid. These pads will be lit according to the selected \ntrack\u2019s color.  \nTo play a drum note,  press a pad. The played pad will be \nlit green while pressed, and then be lit white. Drum Notes are always sent on MIDI Channel 16 in Ableton Live. \n If you are using more than 16 drum slots in the Ableton Live \ndrum rack, use the up and down cursors to shift the pad grid \nselection by one row at a time. Press and hold SHIFT and press \nthe up and down cursors to shift the pad grid selection by \nfour rows at a time. \n When using APC64 as a standalone controller, use use the track-specific Step Sequencer 5.3.1 Configuration  \nmenu to set the track type to Drum to enbable the Drum-style Note Mode layout.  \n \nTo adjust the MIDI note assignments for the drum pad layout, use the Drum1 \u201316 Note  options in the  \n5.6 Global Menu . These settings only affect the Drum Note layout in Step Sequencer mode and standalone \noperation. Drum Note configuration is automatically a ssigned when controlling a drum track in Ableton Live. \n   \n  \n \n \n30 \n  \n5.3 Step Sequencer \n \nThe Step Sequencer is used to create or edit clips by using the pad matrix as \n\u201cstep buttons,\u201d simulating the experience of a traditional step-sequencer-style drum machine.  \nTo enter Step Sequencer mode,  press the STEP SEQ button. \n \nUse the Track Select 1\u20138 buttons to select one of the eight available Step \nSequence tracks. You can also switch between tracks using the left and right \ncursors . The Track Select button for the current track will be brightly lit in \nwhite. \n Step Sequence tracks are internal to APC64 and do not co rrespond with Ableton Live tracks as shown in Session \nView. This means you can send any of the eight Step Se quence tracks to any available track in Ableton Live. \nBy default, Ableton Live monitors and records MIDI on a ll available MIDI channels at on ce. To send specific Step \nSequencer tracks to specific Ableton Live tr acks for recording, use the track-specific 5.3.1 Configuration  menu \ndescribed in the following section to set the Step Sequencer tracks to indi vidual MIDI channels (for instance, \nChannels 4, 5, and 6). Then, set the MIDI From of desired tracks in Ableton Live to Channels 4, 5, and 6. Each \nchannel will now receive the correct MIDI data from the corresponding Step Sequencer track.  \n \n \n5.3.1 Configuration \n \nThe Step Sequencer has two Configuration modes: a Glob al Configuration mode for setting defaults across all \ntracks, and a Track Configuration mode for setting parameters on specific tracks. \nTo configure the global Step Sequencer settings, press the STEP SEQ button a second time while in Step \nSequencer mode, or press and hold SHIFT and press STEP SEQ . You can also momentarily access the \nConfiguration view by pressing and holding the STEP SEQ button while in Step Sequencer mode. When you \nrelease the button, you will return to Step Sequence mode.  \nFrom here, you can adjust the follow ing settings directly from the pads: \n C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 \nR1 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5 Step 6 Step 7 Step 8 \nR2 Step 9 Step 10 Step 11 Step 12 Step 13 Step 14 Step 15 Step 16 \nR3 Step 17 Step 18 Step 19 Step 20 Step 21 Step 22 Step 23 Step 24 \nR4 Step 25 Step 26 Step 27 Step 28 Step 29 Step 30 Step 31 Step 32 \nR5         \nR6 Time Div: \n1/4  Time Div: \n1/4T Time Div: \n1/8  Time Div: \n1/8T Time Div: \n1/16 Time Div: \n1/16T Time Div: \n1/32 Time Div: \n1/32T \nR7         \nR8         \n  \n \n \n31 \n  \nUse Rows 1\u20134  to set the total length of the sequence in steps. When all tracks are set to the same length, the pad \nfor the value of the last step in the sequ ence will be lit green. If there are trac ks with differing lengths, no selection \nwill be shown. \n \nUse Row 6  to set the Time Division for the step sequencer. This determines the note length of each step: \n1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 \n1/4T 1/8T 1/16T 1/32T \nIf all tracks are set to the same time division, the selected  value will be lit green. If there are tracks with differing \ntime divisions, no selection will be shown.  \n \nYou can also use the encoder to change these values as shown on the display . Turn the encoder to browse \neach Step Sequencer category. Press the encoder to open it, and then turn the encoder to browse the available options. When you are finished, press the encoder again to confirm your selection. Some options in the display will prompt you to select a track. See the following section for track-specific Step Sequencer settings.   \n \nStepSeq Config \n1. Last Step \n\uf039   32 \n \n \n \nTo configure the track-specif ic Step Sequencer settings,  press a TRACK SELECT button while the global Step \nSequencer configuration is open. You can also press and hold multiple TRACK SELECT buttons to edit more than \none track at a time. The TRACK SELECT button for the selected track(s) will be brightly lit in white. When editing \nmultiple tracks at once, selections may not be shown on  the pad if they differ between the selected tracks. \nFrom here, you can adjust the follow ing settings directly from the pads: \n C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7 C8 \nR1 Step 1 Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 Step 5 Step 6 Step 7 Step 8 \nR2 Step 9 Step 10 Step 11 Step 12 Step 13 Step 14 Step 15 Step 16 \nR3 Step 17 Step 18 Step 19 Step 20 Step 21 Step 22 Step 23 Step 24 \nR4 Step 25 Step 26 Step 27 Step 28 Step 29 Step 30 Step 31 Step 32 \nR5 Track Type: \nNote Track Type: \nDrum  Swing \nEnable   Send to \nUSB Send to \nMIDI Send to CV \nR6 Time Div: \n1/4  Time Div: \n1/4T Time Div: \n1/8  Time Div: \n1/8T Time Div: \n1/16 Time Div: \n1/16T Time Div: \n1/32 Time Div: \n1/32T \nR7 MIDI Ch:  \n1 MIDI Ch:  \n2 MIDI Ch:  \n3 MIDI Ch:  \n4 MIDI Ch:  \n5 MIDI Ch:  \n6 MIDI Ch:  \n7 MIDI Ch:  \n8 \nR8 MIDI Ch:  \n9 MIDI Ch:  \n10 MIDI Ch:  \n11 MIDI Ch:  \n12 MIDI Ch:  \n13 MIDI Ch:  \n14 MIDI Ch:  \n15 MIDI Ch:  \n16 \n \n \n \n \n32 \n  \nUse Rows 1\u20134  to set the total length of the track\u2019s sequence in steps. The pad for the value of the last step in the \nsequence will be lit green. This will be set to the global  Step Sequence length by default, but can be set to a \ndifferent value per track.  \n Use the Track Type pads ( R5,C1\u20132 ) to set the type of track controlled by the step sequencer. Use Note type for \nmelodic tracks, and Drum type for drum tracks. The pad for the selected type will be lit green. \n Use the Swing Enable pad ( R5,C4 ) to turn swing timing On or Off when using the Step Sequencer. When \nenabled, this pad will be lit green. The swing value can be set by pressing and holding the SHIFT and TEMPO \nbuttons, and then using the encoder to adjust the value between 50%  (no swing) and 75%  (heavy swing). \n \nUse the Send To pads ( R5,C6\u20138 ) to select where the track\u2019s step sequencer data is sent: To USB (to a computer \nconnected to the USB Port ), To MIDI (to devices connected to the MIDI Outputs ), and/or To CV (to devices \nconnected to the CV Outputs ). When enabled, the selected pad will be lit green. \n \nUse Row 6  to set the Time Division for the the track\u2019s step sequencer. This determines the note length of each \nstep: \n1/4 1/8 1/16 1/32 \n1/4T 1/8T 1/16T 1/32T \nThis will be set to the global Time Division by defa ult, but can be set to a different value per track.  \n \nUse Rows 8\u20139  to select the MIDI Channel  that the track\u2019s Step Sequencer data is sent on when connected to USB \nor MIDI, from 1\u201316. \n You can also use the encoder to change these values as shown on the display . Turn the encoder to browse each \nStep Sequencer category. Press the encoder to open it, and then turn the encoder to browse the available options. When you are finished, press the encoder again to confirm your selection. \n \nStepSeq Config \n1. Last Step \n\uf039   32 \n \n  \n5.3.2 Note Input Pads \n The bottom-left quadrant of pads can be used to input notes. The function of these pads depends on the mode \nselected:  \n\u2022 Drum Mode: In Drum Mode, the bottom-left quadrant of pa ds is used like a traditional 4x4 drum pad \nlayout. You can adjust the MIDI note assignments for these pads in the 5.6 Global Menu . \n\u2022 Note Mode: In Note Mode, the bottom-left quadrant of pads represents notes in a scale. The root note \nof the scale will be lit in the color of the selected track. Use the Note and Chord Mode Configuration to \nset the root note and scale type. You can also use the up and down cursors to move the starting note \noctave. \nAfter selecting a mode, all the pads (in Drum Mode) or the root note pads (in Note Mode) will be lit according to \nthe selected track\u2019s color. Press a pad to select th e note and audition the pad\u2019s sound. Press and hold SHIFT and \nthen press a pad to silently select it. \n  \n \n \n33 \n  \n5.3.3 Step Pads \n \nIn Step Sequencer mode, the top four rows of pads represent the steps of the \nsequence. The number of pads available depends on the size and number of the steps. These can be adjusted using the Step Sequencer 5.3.1  Configuration  \nsettings. \n \nWhen no pads from the Note Input pads are selected, the top four rows will \nshow an overview of the sequence, where all steps with a note event added to it are lit according to the track color. The brightness of the pad will also reflect the velocity value or other modifier value for the note event. Unused steps will be unlit.  \n \nWhen a single Note Input Pad is pressed and selected, only steps with the \nselected note added to it will be lit in the top four rows. You can press unlit pads in the top four rows to add the selected note to the selected step. See the 5.3.5  \nRecording Sequences  section  for more information. \n  \n \n   If you press and hold on a filled step pad, all notes assigned to that step in the \nNote Input Pads will be lit green. You can press these green pads in the Drum Mode or Note Mode pad matrix to add or remove the notes assigned to that \nstep. \n      \nThe current play position will be indicated by a green pad .  \nTo play the step sequence, press PLAY .  \nTo stop the step sequence, press  STOP . \nStep Sequences may also be managed and launched using APC64\u2019s built-in \nProject save slots. See the following 5.4 Project Mode  chapter for more \ninformation. \n \n   \n \n \n34 \n  \n5.3.4 Modifer Pads \n \nThe bottom-right quadrant of pads is used  to set the velocity or other modifier \nvalue for each note. By default, this controls the Velocity value of each step. \nYou can swap between viewing VELOCITY , PROBABILITY , or MUTATE by \npressing the Rows 1\u20133 LAUNCH buttons on the right side of the pad grid when \nin Step Sequencer mode.  \n \nWhen Velocity is selected, the pads control the note dynamics as follows: \n C5 C6 C7 C8 \nR5 103 111 119 Full \nR6 71 79 87 95 \nR7 39 47 55 63 \nR8 As Played 15 23 31 \n \nWhen Probability is selected, the pads control the likelihood th at the selected note is played, as follows: \n C5 C6 C7 C8 \nR5 81% 87% 93% 100% \nR6 56% 62% 68% 75% \nR7 31% 37% 43% 50% \nR8 3% 12% 18% 25% \n \nWhen Mutate is selected, the pads determine whether a step will be played at its set pitch or be transposed up \nor down within one octave, as follows. The specific notes are determined by the currently selected key and scale. \nNote:  Mutate is available for Note type  Step Sequencer tracks only. \n C5 C6 C7 C8 \nR5 81% 87% 93% 100% \nR6 56% 62% 68% 75% \nR7 31% 37% 43% 50% \nR8 3% 12% 18% 25% \n  \n \n \n35 \n  \n5.3.5 Recording Sequences \n \nWhen you are ready to add notes to your sequence, you can do this in two ways. You can use the Note Input \nPads to manually add notes to steps, or you can record a performance from the pads into the sequence. \nNote:  You can add up to sixteen notes per step in a Drum sequence, and up to eight notes per step in a Note \nsequence. \nTo manually add a note to the sequence: \n1. Select a note pad from the bottom-left quadrant Note Input Pads.  \n2. Press a pad in the Step Pads. \nThe selected note will be added at the selected step. \n \nTo remove a note from the sequence, do either of the following : \n\u2022 Select a note pad from the bottom-left quadrant Note Input Pads, and then press the Step Pad where you \nwant to remove the note.  \n\u2022 Use the Clear button, as described in the following  section. \n \nWhen inputting notes using the Note Input Pads, you can also create a tie so that a note is held over multiple steps. This is not available when controlling a Drum Track.  \nTo add a tied note that s tretches over multiple steps,  press and hold SHIFT and then press the pad or \npads adjacent to the step that you want tied. These pads  will then be lit in white, and the note will be held \nthroughout the number of steps marked.  \nFor instance, if you want to tie a note between Step 1 an d Step 4, add the first note at Step 1, then press and \nhold SHIFT and press the Steps 2, 3, and 4 pads. \nNote:  Tied notes will not be shown when viewing the sequence overview with no Note Input Pad selected. \nTo remove a tie,  release SHIFT and press the tied pad so it is dimly lit again. \n \n  \n \n \n36 \n  \nIn addition to inputting notes manually using the Step Pads, you can also record a performance from the Note \nInput Pads, or even Note and Chord Mode s directly, into the Step Sequence.  \nTo record a performance into the Step Sequencer: \n1. Press the RECORD ARM Control Row Function button. \n2. Press the Control Row button for the Sequencer track that you want to record on. The button will be lit \nred, and the bottom line of the display will turn red to indicate recording is armed. Only one track may \nbe armed at a time. \nOnce the track is armed, the Note Input Pads will trigger sound on the selected track.  \n3. Press PLAY to begin playback and recording of the sequence . (If the sequence is already playing, arming \nthe track in the previous step will enable it to begin recording immediately.) \n4. Use the Note Input Pads  to add notes, or switch to Note Mode or Chord Mode to add notes or chords. \nNotes will be added to the nearest step, sn apping backward or forward as needed.  \nNote:  When connected to Ableton Live and live recording into the Step Sequencer using Note Mode or \nChord Mode, it is recommended to set the Sequence MIDI Channel to Ch 1  in the track Configuration  \nmenu in order to match the Ableton Live track assignment and hear the audio as you play it. \n5. Recording will continue and begin overdubbing wh en the sequence returns to the beginning.  \n6. To end recording, press the Control Row button for the selected track to disarm recording. Alternatively, \npress the STOP button to stop the sequence playback.  \nTo disable recording, disarm the track by pressing the RECORD ARM Control Row Function button and \nthen pressing the Control Row button for the Sequencer track again. \n \nWhen recording into the Step Sequencer, note lengths and note ties will not be recorded, and you will not be able to manually enter notes using the Step Pads.   \n \n \n37 \n  \n5.3.6 Editing Sequences \n \nUse the CLEAR button to erase notes, steps, or tracks: \nTo clear a note from a step, press the lit pad. \nTo clear all steps containing a specific note, press and hold CLEAR and then \npress the desired Note Input pad.  \nTo clear all notes from a specific step, press and hold CLEAR and then press the \ndesired Step Input pad.  \nTo clear an entire step sequence, press and hold CLEAR and then press the \ndesired Track Select button.   \nNote:  Step Sequencer editing cannot be undone.   \n \nUse the MUTE button to mute notes, steps, or tracks: \nTo mute all notes on a specific step, press and hold the MUTE Control Row \nFunction button, and then press the desired Step Input pad. The muted step pad will be lit bright yellow to indicate it has been muted. Repeat this process to unmute the step. No Note Input Pad may be selected when muting a specific \nstep. \nTo mute a specific note, press and hold the MUTE Control Row Function button, \nand then press the desired Note Input Pad . The muted Note Input Pad will be lit \nbright yellow to indicate it has been muted. Repeat this process to unmute the \nnote.   \nTo mute an entire track, press the MUTE Control Row Function button, and then \npress the Control Row button for the desired track. Repeat this process to unmute \nthe track. \nTo clear all Mutes from the current track, press and hold CLEAR , and then press \nMUTE . All steps and notes will be unmuted and return to their previous state. \nNote:  Note, step, and track mutes are not saved as part of the sequence. Mutes will \nrender when using the 5.3.7 Send to Clip  function to export the sequence into \nAbleton Live. \n Use the SOLO button to solo tracks. Press the SOLO Control Row Function button, \nand then press the Control Row button for the desired track. Repeat this process to \ndisable solo for the track. \n \n  \n \n \n38 \n  \n5.3.7 Send to Clip \n \nIf you would like to export the sequence you have made into Ableton Live, you can use the Send to Clip option \nto capture the sequence data into a new clip.  \n1. While connected to Ableton Live, select a MIDI track and a blank clip slot. \n2. On APC64 (while in Step Sequencer mode), select the track containing the sequence you want to send \nto a clip.  \n3. Press and hold SHIFT  so Send to Clip is shown in the display.  \n4. Press the encoder to continue, or release SHIFT to return. \nNote:  Only one track can send to a clip at a time. The sequencer must also be stopped to send to a clip. \nThe display will show Stop Seq 1st to remind you to stop playback before continuing.  \n5. The display will show Sending\u2026 as it prepares the clip, and then Done! once it has completed. You will \nnow see the exported sequence clip in Session View. \n \nSend To Clip \nNote Track 1 \nPress Enter \n \n    \n \n \n39 \n  \n5.4 Project Mode \n \nAPC64 can save and load up to 24 projects in its internal memory. These projects \ncontain device and performance information, including: \n\u2022 Step Sequence Mode parameters and patterns \n\u2022 Note and Chord Mode parameters \n\u2022 Global parameters \n\u2022 Custom Mode assignments \nThese can be used to recall parameters for certain proj ects or as larger sequences for building a track for \nrecording or performance.  \nTo view the current projects, press the PROJECT button. The top three rows of pads will represent the 24 \navailable project slots.  \nTo load a project, press one of the 24 available project slot pads. \n Projects may be selected and loaded while playback is ac tive. In this way, you can queue up different sequences \nor parameters sets during a performance without stopping playback. \nTo initiate playback of a project, press PLAY . This will begin playing the data in the current project\u2019s 5.3 \nStep Sequencer .  \nTo stop project playback, press STOP . \n \nThe color of each Project pad provides information about its current save status and playback state: \n \nPad Color Project State \nDim White Empty project slot, playback stopped. \nAmber (Solid) Selected proj ect, playback stopped. \nAmber (Blinking) Project with unsaved changes, playback stopped. \nBlue Saved project, unselected. \nGreen (Solid) Selected project, playback in progress. \nGreen (Pulsing) Selected project with un saved changes, playback in progress. \nWhite (Blinking) Project in queue to play after playback of the current project is finished.  \nRed (Blinking) Project with unsaved change s is being navigated away from. Press the encoder \nto confirm you wish to proceed without saving your changes. \n \n  \n \n \n40 \n  \nPlayback of project sequences can also be chained together to create longer sequence patterns.  1. Press and hold a pad containing the first Project sequence you want to use. \n2. While still holding the pad, press another Project slot. The currently selected Project pad will remain amber, \nand all pads between it and the second Project pad pressed will turn yellow. \n3. Press PLAY to begin playback of the project sequence.  \nAll Projects between the two pads will then be chaine d together and play in sequ ence. For instance, if you \npress and hold Project 1 and then press Project 5, playback  will move through Projects 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 before \ncircling back to Project 1 again. The current and next projects will be shown in the display . \n \nProject Mode \nCurr Project: 5 \nNext Project: 1 \n  \n \nThe sequence length for chained proejects is determined by the project with the most steps, regardless of the \ntrack\u2019s time division setting. For example, if Project 1 cont ains thirty-two 1/16 notes, and Project 2 contains sixteen \n1/4 notes, when chained together the sequence length will follow Project 1. \n \nNote:  Only adjacent projects can be chained together to  play in sequential order. You can rearrange your \nprojects using the SAVE AS function to place them in the correct order for sequential playback. See the following \n5.4.1 Managing Projects  section for more information. \n  \n \n \n41 \n  \n5.4.1 Managing Projects \n \nTo save changes to a project in the current slot, press the row five LAUNCH / SAVE \nbutton.   \n  \nTo save your changes to a new project slot:  \n1. Press the row six LAUNCH / SAVE TO\u2026 button.  \n2. Select another one of the 24 Project slots. The pad will begin blinking red.  \n3. Press the encoder to save the project to the selected slot. \n  \nTo delete project information from a slot:  \n1. Press and hold the CLEAR button , and then press the desired Project pad.  \n2.

Using \nProjects lets you maintain many different control configur ations to use in different situations. For instance, you \nmay use different presets for different performances, or use other presets for production with different software.  \nAPC64 can store a maximum of 24 Projects, and you can store additional Proj ects on your computer to load onto \nAPC64 with this editor. \n \nSend Project \nAfter you create custom MIDI assignments using the editor, you can send \nthat preset to be stored in one of APC64\u2019s Project slots.  \nTo send a Project:  1. Go to File > Send Project  (Windows) or APC64 Project Editor > \nSend Project  (macOS). \n2. In the window that appears, select  the desired Project slot. Use the \nRAM option to send the preset to the device without saving it to a \nslot. This lets you try out the preset\u2019s assignments without \u201ccommitting\u201d them to a particular Project. If you decide that you like the results, you can save them to your computer or send them to a specific Project slot. \n3. Click Send Project to send it to the device, or Cancel to return to \nthe Editor. \n \nGet Project If you want to edit an existing pres et on APC64 using the Editor, you can \nuse the Get Project option to retrieve the current MIDI assignments. \nTo import a Project: 1. Go to File > Get Project (Windows) or APC64 Project Editor > \nGet Project  (macOS). \n2. In the window that appears, select the Project slot that you want to \nimport into the Editor. Use the RAM option to retrieve the active \nMIDI assignments, even if they have not been saved to a Project \nslot. \n3. Click Get Project  to send it to the device, or click Cancel to return \nto the Editor. \n \n  \n\n \n \n59 \n  \nSave Project If you want to save a particular Project on your computer  so you can access it later, use the Save Project option. \nTo save a Project: \n1. Go to File > Save Project (Windows) or APC64 Project Editor > Save Project  (macOS). \n2. Select a desired location on your computer to store the file.  \n3. Click Save to save the file as an .APC64  file, or click Cancel to return to the Editor. \n Open Project Projects saved to your computer can be reopened in the Editor to make further changes or send them to your \ndevice: \nTo open a saved Project: 1. Go to File > Open Project (Windows) or APC64 Project Editor > Open Project  (macOS). \n2. Locate the desired .APC64  file using the file browser. \n3. Click Open to load the Project into the editor, or click Cancel to return to the Editor. \n \n \n  \n \n \n60 \n  \n5.7.1.5 Global Settings \n \nIn addition to managing Projects using the Project Edit or, you can also manage the APC64 Global Settings. Your \nAPC64 must be connected to the computer in order to open this window and adjust the settings.  \nTo open the Global Settings, Go to File > Global Settings (Windows) or APC64 Project Editor > Global \nSettings  (macOS). \n \n \n \nFrom this window, you can adjust the following settings: \n\u2022 Current Mode:  Sets whether APC64 is operating in Live Mode or Standalone Mode .  \n\u2022 LED Brightness:  Adjusts the overall brightness level of the device LEDs to 25% , 50% , 75% , or 100% . \n\u2022 Pad Sensitivty:  Adjusts how responsive the pads are. Set to Default for standard sensitivity. Set to Low to \nallow for stronger playing, or High to lighter playing. \n\u2022 Sync Source:  Sets whether the Tempo is synced by the Internal  MIDI clock, by MIDI clock data sent to the \nUSB port, or by MIDI clock data sent to the MIDI DIN  input. \n\u2022 Sync Destination:  Enables or disables whether the internal MIDI clock is sent from the USB port ( Send to \nUSB ) or MIDI DIN output ( Send to MIDI ). \n\u2022 CV Settings:  These settings determine what type of MIDI messages each CV port receives, and what MIDI \nchannel each CV port receives messages from. See the following 5.8 CV Operation chapter for more \ninformation.  \n\u2022 Step Sequencer Drum Note Assignments:  Selects the MIDI note value for the 4x4 pad layout when \ncontrolling a drum instrument in the Step Sequencer. These values are by default mapped to correspond with \nAbleton Live\u2019s Drum Rack. Changing the values could re sult in misaligned mapping when controlling Ableton \nLive. \n  \n\n \n \n61 \n  \nTo retrieve the current Global Device Settings from \nAPC64, click the Get button. The changes will be applied \nimmediately.  \nT o  s e n d  t h e  G l o b a l  D e v i ce Settings to APC64, click the \nSend button.

Use the file browser \nto locate the desired .APC64GlobalSettings  file, and then \nclick Open . \n \n  \n\n \n \n62 \n  \n5.8 CV Operation \n \nAPC64 features eight CV/Gate ports which can be used to connect to and control other CV-compatible devices, \nsuch as synthesizers or drum machines. Use standard 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) TS cables to send a single CV/Gate signal per output. \n \nUse APC64\u2019s 5.6 Global Menu  to access the following CV setup options: \n The CV1 \u20138 Source  options (odd numbers between 5 and 19 in the Global Menu) determine what type of MIDI \nmessages the CV port receives. \nPitch:  Note messages are sent as CV Pitch messages. \n\u2022 Last:  The pitch will change to its new value each time a note message is received. \n\u2022 Low:  The pitch will change when the new note value is lower than the current value. \n\u2022 High:  The pitch will change the new note value is higher than the current value. \n \nGate:  Note messages are sent as Gate messages, which open and close to trigger note ons and note offs. \n\u2022 Last:  The gate is retriggered each time a note message is received. \n\u2022 Low:  The gate is retrigged when the new note  value is lower than the current value. \n\u2022 High:  The gate is retrigged when the new note value is higher than the current value. \n\u2022 Legato:  The gate is only retrigged when all held notes are released and then a new note is triggered. \n \nVelocity:  Note messages are translated into velocity values, variable between 0\u20135 V. \n\u2022 Last:  The velocity will change each time a note message is received. \n\u2022 Low:  The velocity will change when the new note value is lower than the current value. \n\u2022 High:  The velocity will change when the new note value is higher than the current value. \n\u2022 Legato:  The velocity will change when all held notes ar e released and then a new note is triggered. \n \nAftertouch: Channel aftertouch messages on the current channe l are sent as a variable CV signal between \n0\u20135 V. \n \nCC 16\u201323: Continuous controller (CC) messages on the current channel are sent as a variable CV signal \nbetween 0\u20135 V. \n Fader 1\u20138: Messages from the selected fader are sent as a variable CV signal between 0\u20135 V. \n \nDrum 01\u201316: The selected drum pad will send a gate message when pressed.  \n The CV1 \u20138 Channel  options (even numbers between 6 and 20 in th e Global Menu) determine what MIDI channel \neach CV port receives messages from.  \n  \n \n \n63 \n  \n5.8.1 CV Connection Examples \n \nThe following examples describe how to connect the CV/Gate outputs on your APC64 to an external device such \nas a modular or semi-modular analog synthesizer with CV/Gate inputs. In these examples, APC64 will connect to \nthe Moog Music Mother-32 semi-modular analog synthesize r, but the instructions can apply to any device with \ncomparable connections. \n \n5.8.1.1 Standalone Connections \n \nFirst, set up pitch and gate control to send note information from APC64 in standalone mode to your device. \n1. In the 5.6 Global Menu , set the CV1 Source option to Pitch-Last . This will send pitch information (such \nas notes being played in Note Mode) to your device. Since the CV output is monophonic, the pitch will \nchange each time a new note is received when set to Pitch-Last. \n2. Next, set the CV2 Source option to Gate-Last . This will trigger a new note on message each time a new \nnote is played. \n3. Connect the CV1 output to your external CV device. This will usually be connected to a VCO input; in this \ncase, connect to the VCO 1V/OCT input on Mother-32. \n4. Connect the CV2 output to your external CV device. This will usually be connected to a Gate  input; in this \ncase, connect to the Gate input on Mother-32. \n5. Enter Note Mode on APC64 and begin playing the pads . Your external device should begin responding \nto each new note event.  \n For even greater note control, you can contin ue by setting up Veloctiy and Aftertouch. \n1. In the 5.6 Global Menu , set the CV3 Source option to Velocity-Last . This will send velocity MIDI data to \nyour device each time a new value is received.  \n2. Next, set the CV4 Source option to Aftertouch . This will send send poly aftertouch MIDI data to your \ndevice. \n3. Connect the CV3 output to your external CV device. This wi ll usually be connected to a VCA or Velocity \ninput; in this case, connect to the VCA CV input on Mother-32. \n4. Connect the CV4 output to your external CV device. This will usually be connected to ome kind of \nmodulation  input; in this case, try connecting to the VCO Mod input on Mother-32 to use aftertouch to \ncontrol the amount of modulation applied to the signal. \n5. Enter Note Mode on APC64 and begin playing the pa ds. Your external device  should now respond to \nvelocity and aftertouch messages. \n Next, try setting up fader control to use APC64\u2019s touch faders to control other parameters on your device. \n1. In the 5.6 Global Menu , set the CV5 Source \noption to Fader 1 . This will send data from APC64\u2019s Touch \nFader 1 to your device. \n2. Connect the CV3 output to the CV input of the external device parameter that you want to control. In this \ncase, connect to the Mix CV input on Mother-32, allowing you to use the fader to crossfade between the \nVCO waveform and external  audio/white noise.  \n3. As you move your finger up and down the touch fader,  the fader\u2019s values will be converted by APC64 and \nsent to your external CV device to  control the selected parameter.   \nNote:  You can customize the CC number and behavior of the touch fader using the APC64 Project Editor Software \nto further customize fader control. For instance, in the example above you could set the Fader Style  to Pan so \nthat the fader begins at the midpoint of the Mix control and can be moved up or down to adjust the mix balance. \n  \n \n \n64 \n  \nYou can also use the internal Step Se quencer as a control for your external device. You can use the same setups \nas above to control pitch, gate, and velocity from the Step Sequencer data, or you can use the Drum Pad source \noptions to use the CV outputs as gate triggers based on your sequence. \n1. In the 5.6 Global Menu , set the CV1 \u20138 Source options  to Drum Pad 1 \u20138. \n2. Connect the CV1 \u20138 outputs to the inputs of an external CV device. In this example, you could connect \nthese to trigger inputs or to the inputs of other settings that can be open and closed using a gate. \n3. Open the 5.3 Step Sequencer , and then use drum pads 1\u20138 to create a rhythmic sequence. \n4. When you play the sequence, each drum pad note event will send a gate message to the CV device. You \ncan use this to trigger notes or rhyt hmically manipulate other parameters. \n \n \n5.8.1.2 Connections with Ableton Live \n \nIn addition to controlling note information from APC64 in standalone mode, you can use APC64 as an interface \nbetween Ableton Live and your external CV device. \n \nBegin again by setting up pitch, gate, and velocity control,  except this time the MIDI da ta will come from a track \nin Ableton Live. \n1. Make sure your device is in Ableton Live mode in the 5.6 Global Menu  and open Ableton Live. \n2. Follow the same steps above to set the CV1  Source  option to Pitch , the CV2 Source to Gate , and the \nCV3 Source to Velocity , and connect the CV1\u20133 outputs to the same inputs on your device. \n3. In the Global Menu, set the CV1\u20133 Channels to the desired MIDI Channel; in this example, set this to 11.  \n4. In Ableton Live, create a new MIDI Track, and then set the MIDI To output to APC64 . \n5. Set the track\u2019s MIDI To channel to the same channel as the CV1\u20133 Channels , in this case Ch. 11 . \n6. Create a new MIDI clip in your Ableto n Live track, and then use the clip editor to add note information to \nit. \n7. When you launch the clip in Ableton Live, the pitch,  note on/off, and velocity MIDI note data will be \nconverted by APC64 and sent to your external CV device.  \n \nYou can also use Ableton Live to send MIDI CC data to cont rol other parameters like mo dulation on your external \nCV device. Continue by building on the setup above. \n1. In the 5.6 Global Menu , set the CV4 Source option  to CC 16 , and the CV4 Channel to 11. \n2. Connect the CV4 output to the CV input of the external device parameter that you want to control. In this \ncase, try connecting to the VCO Mod input on Mother-32 to use MIDI CC to control the amount of \nmodulation applied to the signal. \n3. In the MIDI track you created above (with MIDI To  set to APC64 and Ch.11 ), add automation using MIDI \nCC 16. You can add this to your clip in Session View (using Clip Envelopes) or to your recording in Arrangement View (using Automation Mode). \n4. Launch the clip again, and this time the MIDI CC 16 au tomation will be converte d by APC64 and sent to \nyour external device to cont rol the selected parameter.  \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n \n \n  \n \n \n65 \n  \n6.0 Appendix \n \n6.1 Technical Specifications \n \nDisplay Graphical full color LCD \nConnections USB-C\u00ae \n8 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) CV/Gate \n2 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) MIDI Output \n1 1/8\u201d (3.5 mm) MIDI Input \nDimensions   \n(width x depth x height) 10.7\u201d x 14.6\u201d x 1.4\u201d \n272 x 371 x 34.5 mm \nWeight 3.5 lb \n1.6 kg \n \nSpecifications are subject to change without notice. \nModel: ADAB \n \n \n \n6.2 Trademarks & Licenses \n \nAkai Professional is a trademark of inMusic Brands, Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. \nAbleton, the Ableton Logo, and the Live logo are trademarks of Ableton AG.

Die Grundt\u00f6ne der Tonleiter leuchten rot, w\u00e4hrend die anderen \nTonleiternoten gelb leuchten.  Wenn eine Clip-Taste gedr\u00fcckt wird, leuchten alle \nClip-Tasten derselben Note und Oktave knallgr\u00fcn , w\u00e4hrend alle Clip-Tasten \nderselben Note in anderen Oktaven hellgr\u00fcn  leuchten.  \n \n \n69  \nUm die Einstellungen f\u00fcr den Noten-Modus zu bearbeiten , halten Sie die \nUmschalttaste  und die siebente  Szene-Starttaste ( Note ) gedr\u00fcckt. Die Matrix der \nClip-Tasten wechselt zum folgenden Layout, mit dem Sie verschiedene Einstellungen f\u00fcr den Noten-Modus anpassen k\u00f6nnen: \n \n Db Eb  Gb Ab Bb  \nC D E F G A B  \n        \nReihen nach \n3. trennen Reihen \nnach 4. \ntrennen Reihen \nnach 5. \ntrennen Reihen nach \n6. trennen     \nReihen nach \n7. trennen Reihen \nnach \nOktave \ntrennen  Noten \nau\u00dferhalb \nder Tonleiter \nein-\n/ausblenden     \nChromatisch Dur  Melodisches \nMolltonleiter Harmonische \nMolltonleiter Dur \nPentatonik Moll \nPentatonik Dorisch Phrygisch \nLydisch Mixolydisch \u00c4olisch Lokrisch Blues Flamenco Ungarisch Ganzton \nOCT -2 OCT -1 OCT 0 OCT 1 OCT 2 OCT 3 OCT 4 OCT 5 \n \n \n70  \nWenn ein Parameter ge\u00e4ndert wird, wird auf den Clip-Tasten eine Animation angezeigt, um die ausgew\u00e4hlte Auswahl zu best\u00e4tigen.  \n \nVerwenden Sie die beiden oberen Reihen der Clip-Tasten, um den gew\u00fcnschten \nGrundton der Tonleiter zu \u00e4ndern. Wenn diese Taste gedr\u00fcckt wird, leuchtet die neue Auswahl gr\u00fcn. Halten Sie eine Grundton-Taste gedr\u00fcckt, um den Namen der aktuell \nausgew\u00e4hlten Tonleiter in der Matrix anzuzeigen. Wenn beispielsweise C ausgew\u00e4hlt \nist, sieht die Matrix folgenderma\u00dfen aus: \n \n \n \n71  \nVerwenden Sie die ersten vier Spalten in der vierten und f\u00fcnften Reihe der Clip-Tasten, um das Notenlayout zu \u00e4ndern. Jede Notenreihe kann durch eine 3., 4., 5., 6., 7. Note oder eine Oktave getrennt werden. Halten Sie eine dieser Tasten gedr\u00fcckt, um den ausgew\u00e4hlten Wert in der Matrix anzuzeigen.  Wenn \nbeispielsweise Reihen nach 5. trennen  ausgew\u00e4hlt ist, sieht die Pad-Matrix \nfolgenderma\u00dfen aus: \n \n \nDr\u00fccken Sie die Taste Noten au\u00dferhalb der Tonleiter ein-/ausblenden , um die \nAnzeige von Noten, die nicht in der aktuell ausgew\u00e4hlten Tonleiter enthalten sind, in den Pad-Reihen zu aktivieren oder zu deaktivieren. Wenn diese Option deaktiviert ist, leuchten die Clip-Tasten f\u00fcr Noten au\u00dferhalb der Tonleiter nicht.  \n \n \n72  \nVerwenden Sie die sechste und siebte Reihe der Clip-Tasten, um den Tonleitertyp auszuw\u00e4hlen.  Halten Sie eine dieser Tasten gedr\u00fcckt, um den Tonleiternamen in der Matrix als Bildlaufbuchstaben anzuzeigen. \n \nVerwenden Sie die achte Reihe der Clip-Tasten, um die Basisoktave f\u00fcr die Pads festzulegen. Halten Sie eine dieser Tasten gedr\u00fcckt, um die aktuelle Oktaveinstellung \nin der Matrix anzuzeigen. Wenn beispielsweise -1 Oktave  ausgew\u00e4hlt ist, sieht die \nPad-Matrix folgenderma\u00dfen aus: \n \n \nUm die Bearbeitung im Noten-Modus zu beenden , lassen Sie sowohl die \nUmschalttaste  als auch die siebte  Szene-Starttaste ( Note ) los. Die Clip-Tasten \n\u00e4ndern ihre Farbe, um die aktualisierten Auswahlen widerzuspiegeln.  \n \n \n \n \n73  \n \n \n74  \nAppendix (English ) \n \nTechnical Specifications \n \nPower USB-bus-powered \nInputs /Outputs 1 USB Type-B Port \nClip Buttons 64  RGB backlit clip-launch buttons in 8x8 matrix \nFaders 8 assignable track faders \n1 assignable main fader \nDimensions \n(width x depth x height)  9.5\u201d x 8.3\u201d x 1.3\u201d \n240 x 210 x 32 mm \nWeight 1.79 lbs. \n0.81 kg \n \nSpecifications are subject to change without notice.   \n \n \n75  \nTrademarks & Licenses \n \nAkai Professional is a trademark of inMusic Brands, Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

For additional product support, visit \nakaipro.com/support . \n \nBasic Features \nThe Akai Expression Pedal can be used with any keyboard or controller equipped with an expression, volume or assignable pedal i nput. Expression pedals give a player control over \nvarious sound parameters, such as volume, filter modulations, and effects, resulting in greater dynamic range and expression in  their performances. By setting the proper control range \nof the pedal, any player can control their keyboard\u2019s or controller\u2019s expression parameter to maximize its potential as an effe ctive tool for live sound sculpting. \nThe Akai Expression Pedal is a universal expression pedal, meaning it will work with any device with an expression pedal input.  However, there are a couple of different standards \nemployed between various manufacturers, so Akai has included a mode switch on the bottom of the pedal for compatibility. When i n the \u201cAkai\u201d position, the Akai Expression Pedal will \nwork with all of Akai Professional keyboards and controllers. When using the Akai Expression Pedal with another company\u2019s devic e, you may need to move this switch to the \u201cOther\u201d \nposition if the pedal is not behaving properly. Keep in mind that the \u201cAkai\u201d position may work on some non-Akai Professional pr oducts\u2014try both switch settings to find the best match \nfor your equipment. \n \nSetup \n1. Please insert the Akai Expression Pedal\u2019s 1/4\u201d plug into the expression pedal input of your keyboard or controller. \n2. Move the Akai Expression Pedal into the fully forward, or \u201cup,\u201d position. Your instrument will now be set to play at full volum e. Adjust the instrument\u2019s output volume to your \ndesired maximum level. \n3. Rock the Akai Expression Pedal pedal back to the \u201cdown\u201d position. Your instrument will now be set to play at its minimum volume , which may be silence. If you do not want to \ncompletely turn down your instrument in this position, adjust the Akai Expression Pedal Trim knob until your instrument reaches  your desired \u201cquiet\u201d volume. \n4. Moving the pedal back and forth will now change the instrument\u2019s volume between its maximum output and your desired minimum out put. \n \nAkai is a trademark of inMusic Brands, Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries.

USB Port:  Use the included USB cable to connect this USB port to (A) your computer or (B) the \nincluded USB power adapter, and then connect the power adapter to a power outlet. \n2. Power Switch:  Turns MPX8 on and off. Remember to use the included USB cable to connect \nMPX8 to a power source first. \n3. SD Card Slot:  Insert a standard SD card containing samples into this slot. Use the MPX8 Editor \n(downloadable for free from www.akaipro.com/mpx8 ) to load samples onto an SD card. If you \nchoose to load samples to an SD card without using the MPX8 Editor, please see the Using Your \nOwn Samples  section of this manual to make sure they are formatted properly. \n4. Main Out:  Use audio cables with standard 1/4\" (6.35 mm) TS connectors to connect these \noutputs to a speaker or amplifier system. For mono sound, connect a cable only to the left (L) output. Adjust the volume of these outputs with the Volume +/\u2013 buttons. \n5. Headphone Out:  Connect stereo headphones with a standard 1/8\" (3.5 mm) plug to this output. \nAdjust the volume of this output with the Volume +/\u2013 buttons. \n6. Display:  Shows MPX8's current parameters and other operations. See the Display Overview  \nsection of this manual for more information. \n7. Data Dial:  Decreases or increases the value of the currently selected parameter. \n8. Select +/\u2013:  Moves up or down through the available parameters shown in the Display.  \n9. Volume +/\u2013:  Adjusts the volume level sent to the Main Out and Headphone Out. Press both \nbuttons at the same time to stop all samples that are currently playing. \n10. Pads:  Use these pads to trigger the samples on an inserted SD card (sold separately). The pads \nare velocity-sensitive and pressure-sensitive, which makes them very responsive and intuitive to play. \nThe pads light up different colors to indicate their current states: \n\u2022 Off (no color):  The pad has no sample assigned to it. \n\u2022 Orange:  The pad has a sample assigned to it. \n\u2022 Green:  The pad's assigned sample is currently playing. \n\u2022 Red:  The pad is currently being edited (whether or not a sample is assigned to it). \nNote:  The pads' pressure sensitivity does not affect sample playback. \"Pressure information\" is \nonly sent out the MIDI Out as polyphonic aftertouch messages when MPX8 is used as a MIDI controller. \n11. MIDI In:  Use the included 1/8\"-to-MIDI cable to connect this output to the MIDI Out of an external \nMIDI device. This is useful if you want to use an external MIDI device to trigger samples assigned \nto MPX8's pads (set each pad's MID parameter to the desired MIDI Note number). MPX8 \nrecognizes MIDI Note On messages over Channel 10  only. \n12. MIDI Out:  Use the included 1/8\"-to-MIDI cable to connect this output to the MIDI In of an external \nMIDI device. MPX8 can then send MIDI Note On and polyphonic aftertouch messages to that \ndevice (set each pad's MID parameter to the desired MIDI Note number). \n13. Kensington\n\u00ae Lock Slot:  This connector is compatible with standard laptop-style Kensington \nsecurity cables for theft protection. \n \nKensington and the K & Lock logo are registered trademarks of ACCO Brands.  \n \n4  \nOperation \n \nDisplay Overview \n \nThis is an overview of MPX8's Display:  \n1. Kit: The number of the preset, either a \nInternal Kit (with an \" i\" prefix) or a User \nKit (with an \" e\" prefix). \n2. Sample Location:  Displays the sample \nlocation, either MPX8's internal sample \nlibrary or an inserted SD card (sold separately). \n3. Message:  Displays information about \nMPX8's current state. This will show an error message if MPX8 cannot execute a command. \n4. Sample Name:  Displays the name of the selected sample from MPX8's internal sample \nlibrary or an inserted SD card (sold separately). \n5. Parameters:  Displays the tuning, reverb, trigger type, level, panning, and MIDI note \nnumber.   \n \nSelecting Kits \n A \"Kit\" includes each pad\u2019s sample location, name and/or number, tuning, reverb level, trigger type, volume level, panning, and MIDI note number.  \nTo select a Kit: \n1. Use the Select +/ \u2013 buttons to move the cursor to \nthe Kit field ( KIT).  \n2. Use the Data Dial to scroll through the kit \nnumbers. (Internal Kits have an \" i\" prefix, and \nUser Kits have an \" e\" prefix.)  \n3. When the desired Kit number is shown, wait a \nfew seconds\u2014the Kit will load automatically.  \n \n \n      \n \n12  \n3\n4\n5\n\n \n5  \nEditing Kits \n \nYou can edit the parameters of each Kit, includi ng the samples assigned to the pads and the \ntuning, trigger type, panning, etc. for each pad.  \nTo assign a sample to a pad: \n1. Select a Kit (as described in the previous Selecting Kits  section). \n2. Press the pad you want to assign a sample to. It will light up red, and the name of the \nsample currently assigned to it (if any) will appear in the display. \n3. Select the Location field ( LOC ) by using the Select +/ \u2013 buttons. \n4. Use the Data Dial to select where your desired sample is located: MPX8's internal memory \n(INT) or an inserted SD card ( CARD ). If you are using your own samples on an SD card, \nplease see the important Using Your Own Samples  section below. \n5. Select the sample name field by using the Select +/ \u2013 buttons.  \n6. Use the Data Dial to select the desired sample. When the desired sample name is shown, \nwait a few seconds\u2014the sample will load automatically. \n \nIMPORTANT!  Your Kit (including its pad assignment s, parameters, etc.) will not be saved \nautomatically! To save it, please see the Saving Kits  section of this manual. \n \n \n \n Using Your Own Samples \n You can use MPX8 to trigger your own samples instead of the ones in MPX8's internal sample library.  \nTo do this, load the sample files onto an SD card (not included) using one of the following: \n\u2022 A standard SD card reader. \n\u2022 The MPX8 Editor , downloadable for free at www.akaipro.com/mpx8 . Instructions \nfor using the editor are included with the download. \n \nPlease note the following: \n\u2022 The samples files must be 16-bit, mono WAVs . They can have a sample rate of 48, \n44.1, 32, 22.05 , or 11.205 KHz .  \n\u2022 The sample files must be located in the root (main) directory of the card and not in \nany subdirectories. \n\u2022 You can use an SD card or SDHC card with a capacity up to 32 GB . \n\u2022 We recommend formatting your SD card to a FAT32  file system (if it is not already) \nand naming your sample files according to this format. This means: \no Do not use any of these characters: \" * / \\ : < > ? |  \no Do not use spaces. \no Limit your file name to 8 characters , if possible. \no Up to 512 files  can be stored in the root directory of the card. \n\u2022 You can assign up to 30 MB 's worth of samples onto MPX8's pads at a time (the \nsample library on your SD card can be la rger, of course). Also, please note that a \nsample's size will be rounded up  when loaded (e.g., a 2.1 MB sample on the SD \ncard will be treated as a 3 MB sample when it is assigned to a pad). \n \n6  \nTo adjust the parameters of a pad: \n1. Use the Select +/\u2013 buttons to highlight the desired \nparameter name. \n2. Use the Data Dial to adjust the parameter value. \n \nThe adjustable parameters are described below: \n \nTuning  TUNE The pitch adjustment of sample assigned to the pad, in \nsemitones. The lowest possible tuning is -4, and the highest is \n4. At 0, the pad will play the sample back at its normal pitch. \nReverb  REV The amount of reverb applied to the sample assigned to the \npad. The lowest amount is 0 (no reverb), and the highest is 10 \n(maximum reverb). \nTrigger  TRIG How the sample plays back when triggered by the pad. When \nset to One-Shot ( 1SH), pressing the pad will play the entire \nsample.  \nWhen set to Hold ( HLD), pressing and holding  the pad will play \nthe sample until you release the pad. If you are still holding the \npad when it reaches the end of the sample, it will loop back to \nthe beginning, looping it continuously until you release the pad. \nWhen set to Loop ( LP), pressing the pad will play the sample, \nlooping it continuously until you press the pad again. \nLevel  LEV The volume level of the sample assigned to the pad. The \nquietest value is 0 (silent), and the loudest is 10. \nPanning  PAN The left-right balance of the sample assigned to the pad. The \nleft-most value is L4, the right-most value is R4, and the center \nis CTR. \nMIDI Note Number  MID The MIDI note message sent out when you press the pad. The \navailable values are 000 \u2013 127 . This value does not affect the \nsample assigned to the pad; it changes the MIDI note message sent out MPX8's MIDI Out port and the MIDI note message \nMPX8 recognizes sent into its MIDI In port. \n \nSaving Kits \n \nIf you change the currently selected Kit (in the KIT field), you will lose any changes you have made \nunless you save it first. \n \nTo save the currently selected Kit: \n1. Press Select + and Volume + simultaneously. The Display will ask if you want to save the \ncurrent Kit.  \n2. Press the Volume + button ( Yes) to save the kit or the Volume \u2013 button ( No) to cancel. \nPlease note:  Saving a kit will overwrite all the pad assignments, parameters, etc. since the last \ntime you saved it.  \n \nTo copy and save the current Kit's settings to a new User Kit: \n1.

Para guardarlo, consulte la secci\u00f3n C\u00f3mo guardar los kits  de este manual. \n \nC\u00f3mo usar sus propias muestras \n \nEs posible usar el MPX8 para di sparar sus propias muestras en lugar de las de la biblioteca \ninterna del MPX8. \n \nPara hacerlo, cargue los archivos de las muestras en una tarjeta SD (no incluida) utilizando una de las siguientes opciones: \n\u2022 Un lector de tarjetas SD est\u00e1ndar. \n\u2022 El MPX8 Editor , que se puede descargar gratuitamente en www.akaipro.com/mpx8 . \nLas instrucciones para usar el edito r se incluyen en la descarga. \n \nTenga en cuenta lo siguiente: \n\u2022 Los archivos de muestras deben ser WAV mono de 16 bits. Pueden tener una \nfrecuencia de muestreo de 48, 44.1 , 32, 22.05 o 11.205 kHz .  \n\u2022 Los archivos de las muestras deben ubicarse en  el directorio ra\u00edz (principal) de la \ntarjeta y no en un subdirectorio. \n\u2022 Es posible usar una tarjeta SD o SDHC con capacidad de hasta 32 GB . \n\u2022 Recomendamos que formatee su tarjeta SD al sistema de archivos FAT32  (si no est\u00e1 \nya formateada) y asigne nombre a sus archivos de muestras de acuerdo a este formato. Esto significa lo siguiente: \no No use ninguno de estos caracteres: \" * / \\ : < > ? |  \no No use espacios. \no Limite el nombre de su archivo a 8 caracteres , si es posible. \no Pueden almacenarse hasta 512 archivos  en el directorio ra\u00edz de la tarjeta. \n\u2022 Es posible asignar hasta 30 MB  de muestras en los pads del MPX8 a la vez (la \nbiblioteca de muestras de su tarjeta SD puede ser de mayor tama\u00f1o, por supuesto). \nTenga en cuenta tambi\u00e9n que el tama\u00f1o de la muestra se redondea  cuando se carga \n(por ej., una muestra de 2.1 MB de la tarjeta SD se trata como una muestra de 3 MB \ncuando se asigna a un pad). \n \n12  \nPara ajustar los par\u00e1metros de un pad: \n1. Use los botones Select +/\u2013 para resaltar el nombre del \npar\u00e1metro deseado. \n2. Use el cuadrante de datos para ajustar el valor del \npar\u00e1metro. \n \nSe describen a continuaci\u00f3n los par\u00e1metros ajustables: \n \nAfinaci\u00f3n  TUNE Ajuste de tono de la muestra as ignada al pad, en semitonos. La \nafinaci\u00f3n m\u00ednima posible es -4 y la m\u00e1xima 4. En 0, el pad \nreproduce la muestra a su tono normal. \nReverberaci\u00f3n  REV Cantidad de reverberaci\u00f3n aplicada a la muestra asignada al pad. \nLa cantidad m\u00ednima es 0 (sin reverberaci\u00f3n) y la m\u00e1xima 10 \n(m\u00e1xima reverberaci\u00f3n). \nDisparo  TRIG Forma en que se reproduce la muestra cuando la dispara el pad. \nCuando se configura como un toque ( 1SH), al pulsar el pad se \nreproduce la muestra completa.  \nCuando se configura como retenci\u00f3n ( HLD), al pulsar y retener  el \npad se reproduce la muestra hasta que se suelta el pad. Si a\u00fan est\u00e1 \nreteniendo el pad cuando llega el final de la muestra, volver\u00e1 al \ncomienzo, realizando un loop cont inuo hasta que usted suelte el \npad. \nCuando se configura como loop ( LP), al pulsar el pad se reproduce \nla muestra, produciendo un loop c ontinuo hasta que usted pulse el \npad nuevamente. \nNivel  LEV Nivel de volumen de la muestra asignada al pad. El valor de menos \nvolumen es 0 (silencio), mientras que el de mayor  sonoridad es 10. \nPaneo  PAN Balance izquierda-derecha de la muestra asignada al pad. El valor \ndel extremo izquierdo es L4, el del extremo derecho es R4 y el \ncentral es CTR. \nN\u00famero de nota MIDI  MID Mensaje de nota MIDI enviado cu ando usted pulsa el pad. Los \nvalores disponibles son 000 \u2013 127 . Este valor no afecta a la muestra \nasignada al pad, cambia el mensaj e de nota MIDI enviado desde el \npuerto de salida MIDI del MPX8 y el mensaje de nota MIDI \nreconocido por el MPX8 como enviado a su puerto de entrada MIDI. \n \nC\u00f3mo guardar los kits \n \nSi cambia el kit seleccionado en ese momento (en el campo KIT), perder\u00e1 los cambios que haya hecho a \nmenos que los guarde primero. \n \nPara guardar el kit seleccionado actualmente: \n1. Pulse Select + y Volume + simult\u00e1neamente. La pantalla le preguntar\u00e1 si desea guardar el kit actual.  \n2. Pulse el bot\u00f3n Volume + ( S\u00ed) para guardar el kit o el bot\u00f3n Volume \u2013 ( No) para cancelar. \nPara tener en cuenta:  Al guardar un kit se sobrescriben todas  las asignaciones de pads, par\u00e1metros, \netc., existentes desde la \u00faltima vez que lo guard\u00f3.  \n \nPara copiar y guardar la configuraci\u00f3n de  un kit actual en un nuevo kit del usuario: \n1.

Parametri:  mostra a display sintonia, riverbero, tipo di trigger, livello, panning e numero di \nnota MIDI.   \n \nScelta dei Kit \n Un \"Kit\" comprende, per ciascu n pad, ubicazione del campione,  nome e/o numero, sintonia, \nlivello di riverbero, tipo di  trigger, livello del volume, panning e numero di nota MIDI. \n \nPer selezionare un Kit: \n1. Servirsi dei tasti Select +/ \u2013 per far spostare il \ncursore sul campo Kit ( KIT).  \n2. Servirsi della manopola dati per scorrere lungo i \nnumeri dei kit. (I Kit interni recano il prefisso \" i\", \nmentre i Kit utente recano il prefisso \" e\".)  \n3. Quando compare il numero di Kit desiderato, \nattendere alcuni secondi e il Kit si caricher\u00e0 automaticamente.  \n \n      \n \n \n12  \n3\n4\n5\n\n \n23  \nModifica dei Kit \n \n\u00c8 possibile modificare i parametri di ciascun Kit, inclusi i campioni assegnati ai pad nonch\u00e9 \nsintonia, tipo di tirgger, panning, ecc. per ciascun pad.  \nPer assegnare un campione a un pad: \n1. Selezionare un Kit (come descritto nel precedente paragrafo Scelta dei Kit ). \n2. Premere il pad cui si desidera assegnare un camp ione. Questo si accender\u00e0 di rosso e il \nnome del campione attualmente ad esso assegnato (se presente) comparir\u00e0 a display. \n3. Selezionare il campo Location ( LOC ) servendosi dei tasti Select +/ \u2013 . \n4. Servirsi della manopola dati per scegliere l'ubicazione del campi one desiderato: la \nmemoria interna dell'MPX8 ( INT) o una scheda SD inserita ( CARD ). Se si utilizzano i \npropri campioni su una scheda SD, si veda l'importante paragrafo Utilizzo dei propri \ncampioni  qui di seguito. \n5. Selezionare il campo relativo al nome del campione servendosi dei tasti Select +/ \u2013.  \n6. Servirsi della manopola dati per scegliere il campione desiderato. Quando compare il \nnome del campione desiderato, attendere alcu ni secondi e il campione si caricher\u00e0 \nautomaticamente. \n IMPORTANTE!  Il Kit (incluse le assegnazioni dei pad, i parametri, ecc.) non sar\u00e0 salvato \nautomaticamente! Per salvarlo, si veda la sezione Salvataggio dei Kit  del presente manuale. \n \n Utilizzo dei propri campioni \n \n\u00c8 possibile utilizzare l'MPX8 per attivare i propri campioni anzich\u00e9 quelli contenuti nella \nlibreria di campioni interna dell'MPX8.  Per fare ci\u00f2, caricare i file dei campioni su una scheda SD (non in dotazione) servendosi di: \n\u2022 un lettore di schede SD standard. \n\u2022 L'MPX8 Editor , scaricabile gratuitamente dalla pagina www.akaipro.com/mpx8 . \nIstruzioni per l'uso dell'editor sono incluse con il download. \n \nSi noti quanto segue: \n\u2022 i file dei campioni devono essere 16 bit, mono WAV . Possono avere una frequenza di \ncampionamento di 48, 44.1, 32, 22.05  o 11.205 KHz .  \n\u2022 I file dei campioni si devono trovare nella  directory principale della scheda e non in \nqualsiasi sottocartella. \n\u2022 \u00c8 possibile utilizzare una scheda SD o una scheda SDHC con una capacit\u00e0 fino a un \nmassimo di 32 GB . \n\u2022 Si consiglia di formattare la scheda SD per un sistema FAT32  (se non lo \u00e8 ancora) e di \nnominare i file campione in base a questo formato. Ci\u00f2 significa: \no Non utilizzare alcuno dei seguenti caratteri: \" * / \\ : < > ? |  \no Non utilizzare spazi. \no Limitare il nome del file a 8 caratteri , se possibile. \no Nella directory principale della sc heda \u00e8 possibile memorizzare fino a un \nmassimo di 512 file . \n\u2022 \u00c8 possibile assegnare fino un massimo di 30 MB  di campioni per volta ai pad \ndell'MPX8 (naturalmente la libreria campi oni della scheda SD pu\u00f2 essere pi\u00f9 grande). \nInoltre, va notato che la dimensione di un campione sar\u00e0 arrotondata  quando questo \nviene caricato (ad es. un campione da 2.1 MB sulla scheda SD sar\u00e0 trattato come un \ncampione da 3 MB quando \u00e8 assegnato a un pad). \n \n24  \nPer regolare i parametri di un pad: \n1. Servirsi dei tasti Select +/\u2013 per evidenziare il nome del \nparametro desiderato. \n2. Servirsi della manopola dati per regolare il valore del \nparametro. \n \nI parametri regolabili sono descritti qui di seguito:  \nSintonia  TUNE Regolazione del pitch del campione assegnato al pad, in semitoni. \nL'impostazione minima possibile \u00e8 -4, e quella massima \u00e8 4. A 0, il \npad riproduce il campione al suo pitch normale. \nReverb  REV Quantit\u00e0 di riverbero applicata al campione assegnato al pad. Il \nvalore minimo \u00e8 0 (nessun riverbero), quello massimo 10 (riverbero \nmassimo). \nTrigger  TRIG Modalit\u00e0 di riproduzione del campione quando attivato dal pad. \nQuando impostato su One-Shot ( 1SH), premendo il pad verr\u00e0 \nriprodotto l'intero campione.  \nQuando impostato su Hold ( HLD), premendo e mantenendo la \npressione  sul pad verr\u00e0 riprodotto il campione fino a quando non \nviene rilasciata la pressione dal pad. Se si continua a tenere premuto il pad quando giunge alla fine del campione, questo torner\u00e0 all'inizio e continuer\u00e0 il loop fino a quando non verr\u00e0 rilasciato il pad. \nQuando impostato su Loop ( LP), premendo il pad il campione verr\u00e0 \nriprodotto ininterrottamente fino a quando non si premer\u00e0 \nnuovamente il pad stesso. \nLevel (livello)  LEV Il livello del volume del campione assegnato al pad. Il valore pi\u00f9 \nbasso \u00e8 0 (silente), e quallo pi\u00f9 alto \u00e8 10. \nPanning  PAN L'equilibrio sinistro-destro del campione assegnato al pad. Il valore \nall'estrema sinistra \u00e8 L4, quello all'estrema destra R4, quello \ncentrale CTR. \nNumero di nota MIDI  MID Il messaggio nota MIDI inviato quando viene premuto il pad. I valori \ndisponibili sono 000 \u2013 127 . Questo valore non influenza il campione \nassegnato al pad; cambia il messaggi o nota MIDI inviato tramite la \nporta uscita MIDI dell'MPX8 e il messaggio nota MIDI che l'MPX8 \nriconosce inviato alla sua porta di ingresso MIDI. \n \nSalvataggio dei Kit \n \nSe si cambia il Kit attualmente selezionato (nel campo KIT), verranno persi tutti i cambiamenti effettuati, a \nmeno che non siano stati salvati in precedenza. \n \nPer salvare il Kit attu almente selezionato: \n1. Premere Select + e Volume + contemporaneamente. A di splay verr\u00e0 chiesto se si desidera salvare il \nKit corrente.  \n2. Premere il tasto Volume + ( Yes) per salvare il kit o il tasto Volume \u2013 ( No) per annullare. \nNota bene:  il salvataggio del kit sovrascriver\u00e0 tutte le a ssegnazioni, i parametri, ecc. del pad dall'ultima \nvolta in cui \u00e8 stato salvato.  \n \nPer copiare e salvare le impostazioni del Kit corrente su un nuovo Kit utente: \n1. Assicurarsi che una scheda SD sia inserita nell'apposito slot. \n2. Premere contemporaneamente Select \u2013 e Volume \u2013. A display verr\u00e0 chie sto se si desidera salvare il \nKit su un nuovo Kit. \n3. Premere il tasto Volume + ( Yes) per salvare il kit o il tasto Volume \u2013 ( No) per annullare.

Parameter:  Zeigt Tuning, Reverb, Trigger-Typ, Pegel, Panning und MIDI-Notennummer \nan.  \n \nAuswahl der Kits \n Ein \"Kit\" beinhaltet folgende Daten: den Sa mple-Speicherort des Pads, Name und/oder \nNummer, Tuning, Reverb-Anteil, Trigger-Typ , Lautst\u00e4rke, Panning und die MIDI-Notennummer. \n \nSo w\u00e4hlen Sie ein Kit aus: \n1. Verwenden Sie die Tasten Auswahl +/ -, um den \nCursor auf das Kit-Feld zu bewegen ( KIT).  \n2. Verwenden Sie das Datenrad, um durch die Kit-\nNummern zu bl\u00e4ttern. (Interne Kits haben das \nPr\u00e4fix \" i\", Benutzer-Kits das Pr\u00e4fix \" e\" \nvorangestellt.)  \n3. Wenn die gew\u00fcnschte Kit-Nummer angezeigt \nwird, warten Sie einige Sekunden - das Kit wird automatisch geladen.  \n  \n \n      \n12  \n3\n4\n5\n\n \n29  \nSo bearbeiten Sie Kits \n \nSie k\u00f6nnen die Parameter f\u00fcr jedes Kit bearbeiten,  einschlie\u00dflich der Samples, die den Pads \nzugeordnet sind, und dem Tuning, Trigger -Typ, Panning etc. f\u00fcr jedes Pad. \n \nSo weisen Sie einem Pad ein Sample zu: \n1. W\u00e4hlen Sie ein Kit aus (so wie im vorherigen Abschnitt Auswahl der Kits  beschrieben \nwurde). \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie das Pad, dem Sie ein Sample zu weisen m\u00f6chten. Es leuchtet nun rot. Der \nName des Samples, das derzeit zugewiesen ist (falls vorhanden), wird am Display \nangezeigt. \n3. W\u00e4hlen Sie das Feld Speicherort ( LOC ), indem Sie die Tasten Auswahl +/ - verwenden. \n4. Mit dem Datenrad w\u00e4hlen Sie aus, wo sich das gew\u00fcnschte Sample befindet: Entweder im \ninternen Speicher des MPX8 ( INT) oder auf einer eingelegten SD-Karte ( CARD). Wenn \nSie Ihre eigenen Samples auf einer SD-Karte verwenden, lesen Sie bitte den folgenden wichtigen Abschnitt Verwenden Ihrer eigenen Samples . \n5. W\u00e4hlen Sie das Sample-Namensfeld mit den Tasten Auswahl +/\n- aus.  \n6. Verwenden Sie das Datenrad, um das gew\u00fcnschte Sample auszuw\u00e4hlen. Wenn der \nName des gew\u00fcnschten Samples angezeigt wird, warten Sie einige Sekunden - das Sample wird automatisch geladen. \n \nWICHTIG!  Ihr Kit (einschlie\u00dflich seiner Pad-Zuordnungen, Parameter etc.) wird nicht \nautomatisch gespeichert! Um es zu s peichern, lesen Sie bitte den Abschnitt Kits speichern in \ndiesem Handbuch. \n \n \n Verwenden Ihrer eigenen Samples \n \nSie k\u00f6nnen Ihr MPX8 verwenden, um Ihre eigenen Samples anstelle der Samples der internen MPX8-Bibliothek zu triggern. \n \nDazu laden Sie die Sample-Dateien auf eine SD-K arte (nicht im Lieferumfang enthalten) und \nverwenden entweder: \n\u2022 Einen standardm\u00e4\u00dfigen SD-Kartenleser oder \n\u2022 den MPX8 Editor , der auf www.akaipro.com/mpx8  als kostenloser Download \nverf\u00fcgbar ist. Die Download-Datei enth\u00e4lt Anweisungen zur Verwendung des Editors. \n \nBitte beachten Sie folgendes: \n\u2022 Die Sample-Dateien m\u00fcssen 16-Bit, Mono WAVs  sein. Sie k\u00f6nnen eine Abtastrate von \n48, 44,1, 32, 22,05  oder 11,205 KHz  haben.  \n\u2022 Die Sample-Dateien m\u00fcssen im Hauptverz eichnis der Karte und nicht in einem \nUnterverzeichnis gespeichert sein. \n\u2022 Sie k\u00f6nnen eine SD- oder SDHC-Karte mi t einer Kapazit\u00e4t von bis zu 32 GB  \nverwenden. \n\u2022 Wir empfehlen, die SD-Karte auf ein FAT32-Dateisystem zu formatieren (falls dies \nnicht schon geschehen ist) und Ihre Sample-Dateien diesem Format entsprechend zu \nbenennen. Dies bedeutet: \no Verwenden Sie keine der folgenden Zeichen: \" * / \\ : < > ? |  \no Verwenden Sie keine Leerzeichen. \no Beschr\u00e4nken Sie Ihre Dateinamen m\u00f6glichst auf 8 Zeichen . \no Im Hauptverzeichnis der Karte k\u00f6nnen bis zu 512 Dateien  gespeichert werden. \n\u2022 Sie k\u00f6nnen den MPX8-Pads gleichzeitig Samples von bis zu 30 MB  zuweisen (die \nSample-Bibliothek auf der SD-Karte kann nat\u00fcrlich gr\u00f6\u00dfer sein). Beachten Sie auch, \ndass die Sample-Gr\u00f6\u00dfe beim Laden aufgerundet  wird (ein 2,1 MB Sample wird auf der \nSD-Karte z.B. als 3 MB Sample behandelt, wenn es einem Pad zugeordnet ist). \n \n30  \nSo passen Sie die Parameter eines Pads an: \n1. Verwenden Sie die Tasten Auswahl +/-, um den \ngew\u00fcnschten Parameter zu markieren. \n2. Verwenden Sie das Datenrad, um den Wert des \nParameters einzustellen. \n \nDie einstellbaren Parameter sind nachfolgend beschrieben:  \nTuning  TUNE Die Pitch-Anpassung des Samples, das dem Pad zugewiesen ist, in \nHalbtonschritten. Das tiefste Tuning ist -4, das h\u00f6chste 4. Bei 0 gibt das \nPad das Sample in seiner normalen Tonh\u00f6he wieder. \nReverb  REV Der Reverb-Anteil, der dem Sample  hinzugef\u00fcgt wird, der einem Pad \nzugewiesen ist. Der niedrigste Wert ist 0 (kein Reverb), der h\u00f6chste ist 10 \n(maximaler Reverb). \nTrigger  TRIG Wie ein Sample wiedergegeben wird, wenn es mit dem Pad getriggert \nwird. Bei der Einstellung One-Shot ( 1SH) wird beim Bet\u00e4tigen eines Pads \ndas gesamte Sample abgespielt.  \nBei der Einstellung Halten ( HLD) halten Sie das Pad gedr\u00fcckt , um das \nSample abzuspielen. Das Sample wird so lange abgespielt bis Sie das \nPad loslassen.  Wenn das Sample bis zum Ende gespielt wurde und Sie \ndas Pad weiterhin gedr\u00fcckt halten,  beginnt die Wiedergabe vom Anfang \ndes Samples und wird kontinuierlich in einem Loop wiedergegeben, bis Sie das Pad loslassen. \nBei der Einstellung Loop ( LP) wird das Sample beim Bet\u00e4tigen des Pads \nkontinuierlich im Loop abgespielt bi s Sie das Pad erneut dr\u00fccken. \nPegel  LEV Der Lautst\u00e4rkepegel des Samples, das  dem Pad zugewiesen ist. Der \nleiseste Wert ist 0 (stumm), der lauteste ist 10. \nPanning  PAN Die Links-Rechts-Balance des Sample s, das dem Pad zugewiesen ist. Der \nWert ganz links ist L4, der Wert ganz rechts R4 und die Mitte ist CTR. \nMIDI-Notennummer  MID Die MIDI-Note, die gesendet wird, wenn Sie das Pad dr\u00fccken. Die \nverf\u00fcgbaren Werte reichen von 000 bis 127 . Dieser Wert hat keinen \nEinfluss auf das Sample, das dem Pad zugewiesen ist; es \u00e4ndert die MIDI-\nNotennachricht, die vom MI DI-Out-Port des MPX8 gesendet wird bzw. die \nMIDI-Notennachricht, die in seinen MIDI In-Port gesendet und vom MPX8 \nerkannt wird. \n \nKits speichern \n \nWenn Sie das aktuell ausgew\u00e4hlte Kit (im KIT-Feld) ver\u00e4ndern, verlieren Sie alle von Ihnen vorgenommenen \n\u00c4nderungen, wenn Sie das Kit nicht zuerst speichern. \n \nSo speichern Sie das akt uell ausgew\u00e4hlte Kit: \n1. Dr\u00fccken Sie Auswahl + und Lautst\u00e4rke + gleichzeit ig. Am Display werden Sie gefragt, ob Sie das \naktuelle Kit speichern m\u00f6chten.  \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie die Taste Lautst\u00e4rke + ( Ja), um das Kit zu speichern oder die Taste Lautst\u00e4rke - ( Nein ), \num abzubrechen. \nBitte beachten Sie:  Beim Speichern eines Kit werden alle P ad-Zuordnungen, Parameter, etc. seit dem \nletzten Mal Speichern \u00fcberschrieben.  \n \nSo kopieren und speichern Sie die aktuellen Kit-Einstellungen in ein neues Benutzer-Kit: \n1. Vergewissern Sie sich, dass eine SD-Karte im SD-Kartensteckplatz  eingesteckt ist. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie gleichzeitig die Tast en Auswahl - und Lautst\u00e4rke -. Am Di splay werden Sie gefragt, ob Sie \ndas aktuelle Kit in ein neues Kit speichern m\u00f6chten.  \n3. Dr\u00fccken Sie die Taste Lautst\u00e4rke + ( Ja), um das Kit zu speichern oder die Taste Lautst\u00e4rke - ( Nein ), \num abzubrechen. MPX8 wird das Kit auf die n\u00e4c hste verf\u00fcgbare Benutzer-Kit-Nummer speichern \n(wenn Sie z.B. bereits 12 Benutzer-Kits auf der  SD-Karte gespeichert haben, ist das n\u00e4chste \nverf\u00fcgbare Benutzer-Kit e13). \n\n \n31  \nNachrichten \n \nDas Display des MPX8 kann folgende Nachrich ten \u00fcber den gegenw\u00e4rtigen Status anzeigen: \n \nProcessing  Das Sample wird gerade in den MPX8-Speicher geladen. Bitte warten Sie! \nReading SD Card  MPX8 liest die SD-Karte. Bitte warten Sie!\nSave Complete Das Kit wurde erfolgreich gespeichert.\nStop All Sounds  Diese Nachricht wird angezeigt, nachdem Sie beide Lautst\u00e4rketasten +/- gleichzeitig \ngedr\u00fcckt haben, was alle derzeit wiedergegebenen Samples stoppt. \n \nDas Display des MPX8 kann folgende Fehlermeldung en anzeigen, wenn Ihr MPX8 einen Befehl nicht \nausf\u00fchren kann. Beachten Sie folgende Informationen, um das Problem zu beheben: \n \n<Empty>  Das gew\u00fcnschte Sample befindet sich nicht mehr auf der SD-Karte.

In this manual, you\u2019ll find instructions on how to set up the EWI USB with Aria and an outline of its capabilities. \n SOFTWARE OVERVIEW \n \n SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS \nTo use Aria, your system must meet the following requirements: \nPC MAC \n\u0083 2.8 GHz, Pentium 4/Athlon 4 processor (or better) \n\u0083 Windows 2000 (XP or Vista recommended) \n\u0083 1.2 GB free hard drive space required \n\u0083 1GB RAM required (2 GB RAM recommended) \n\u0083 7200 RPM hard drive speed \n\u0083 DVD-ROM drive required for installation \n\u0083 1024 x 768 (or better) monitor resolution \n\u0083 ASIO-compatible sound card \u0083 2.0 GHz, PowerPC G5 processor (or better) \n\u0083 Mac OS X 10.4 (or higher) \n\u0083 1.2 GB free hard drive space required \n\u0083 1GB RAM required (2 GB RAM recommended) \n\u0083 7200 RPM hard drive speed \n\u0083 DVD-ROM drive required for installation \n\u0083 1024 x 768 (or better) monitor resolution \n \n \n INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE \n1. Insert the software DVD (included) into your computer\u2019s CD/DVD drive. The setup window should open automatically. \n2. Double-click on Setup  and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. (We recommend closing all other \nopen applications before beginning the installation process.) \n3. Once installation of both the software and samples have successfuly completed, you may open the software. (No \nadditional driver inst allation is needed. The computer will install all the necessary drivers automatically.) \n\u0083 Windows (XP or Vista):  You can find the software application in the Program Files  folder or, if you \nchose to create shortcuts, on the Desktop or in the programs listed in the Start Menu . \n\u0083 Mac:  You can find the software application in the Applications  folder. \n \n GET STARTED! \n \nAfter installing the software, you\u2019re ready to begin playing!   Below is a quick explanation of how to start making music on th e \nEWI USB with the software.   \n \n1. Connect the EWI USB to your computer using a standard USB \ncable (included).  The Status LED on the EWI USB should light up, indicating the computer recognizes it. \n2. Find the software \u2013 titled \u201cAkai EWI USB\u201d \u2013 in the appropriate \nlocation: \n\u0083 Windows (XP or Vista):  You can find the software application in \nthe Program Files  folder or, if you chose to create shortcuts, on \nthe Desktop or in the programs listed in the Start Menu . \n\u0083 Mac:  You can find the software application in the Applications  \nfolder. \n3. Go to the Tools  menu, then Preferences . Then, under \u201cInput MIDI \nDevices\u201d check the appropriate box:  \n\u0083 Windows XP:  Select \u201cUSB Audio Device.\u201d  If you have other \nUSB audio devices connected to your computer, you may have \nto determine which one is the EWI USB. \n\u0083 Windows Vista and Mac:  Select \u201cEWI USB.\u201d \n4. Be sure you have selected the Output MIDI Device, Audio Device, and any other settings appropriate for your computer \nand audio setup. \n5. To find an instrument sound to play with the EWI USB, click on the Instrument  field of first channel (which should be \nlabeled \u201cempty\u201d).  Select an instrument from the drop-down menu.  You should see the pitch range of the instrument \nhighlighted on the virtual Keyboard  at the bottom of the window. \n6. Adjust the parameter settings to the right (in the Mix, Controls , and Reverb  tabs) to your preference. \n7. Play the EWI USB by blowing into the mouthpiece.  As the note plays, you should see corresponding key on the \nKeyboard at the bottom of the wndow. \n \nFor a more in-depth explanation of the software\u2019s features, continue reading the rest of this manual. IMPORTANT!  Plugging in the EWI USB \nautomatically recalibrates its keys, \nrollers, and plates.  To avoid interfering with this process (and causing it to play \nout of tune), hold the EWI USB only by \nits plastic casing  near the top while \nplugging it in. \n \n2  \n MENU \n \n FILE \n \nLoad: Select this to choose an .aria file to load in the software.  An .aria file contains previously saved instruments and \nparameter settings \u2013 that is, the sounds you assigned to each channel along with their volume levels, reverb levels, etc.  \nLoading an .aria file allows you to recall those previously saved settings conveniently.  You can also load .aria files by drag ging \nthe file itself over the software window. \nSave As\u2026: Select this to save the current instruments and parameter settings as an .aria file.  You can conveniently restore \nthese settings in the future by loading the file.  ( Note:  Saving will only save the instrument \u201cdefinition\u201d files, not  the actual sound \nsamples themselves.  When loading an .aria file, those samples will have to be available in order to recreate the sound you \nwant. ) \nSave As Default: Select this to set the current software settings as the default.  The next time you open the software, these \ninstruments and parameter settings will be automatically recalled. \n \n TOOLS \n \n\u0084 Preferences    \nInput MIDI Devices: Select the EWI USB from this menu to use it \nwith the software.   \n\u0083 Windows XP:  Select \u201cUSB Audio Device.\u201d (If you have \nother USB audio devices connected to your computer, you \nmay have to determine which one is the EWI USB.) \n\u0083 Windows Vista and Mac:  Select \u201cEWI USB.\u201d  \nOutput MIDI Devices:  Select the appropriate Output MIDI Device \nfrom this menu. \nAudio Device API: Select the appropriate API (application \nprogramming interface) for the EWI USB.  \nAudio Device: Select the appropriate Audio Device from this \nmenu.  \nStereo Pair: Select the stereo outputs through which you will \nhear the audio.  \nSample Rate: Select your desired sample rate from this drop-\ndown menu.  Depending on the sound card and driver you are \nusing, various sample rates are available, but the default is 44.1 \nkHz. \nBuffer Size: Select your desired buffer size from this drop-down \nmenu.  In general, keep this setting as low as possible to reduce \nlatency (the delay between when you play the note and when the note sounds in the software).  Smaller buffer sizes will give a \nfaster response but lower fidelity sound.  Larger buffer sizes will \ngive you a slower response with higher fidelity sound. \n \n \n \n  \n \n\n \n3  \n\u0084 EWI Configuration    \n \n \n \nThese buttons appear on all three screens: \nReset: Restores the default Setup Controls , Performance Controls , and \nController Configuration . \nLoad: Click this button to load a Sysex file, which will import previously saved \ncontroller settings to your EWI Configuration .  Note that you can load any Sysex file \n(that includes settings for a breath controller), not just ones you have saved with this \nsoftware. \nSave: Saves the current Setup Controls , Performance Controls , and Controller \nConfiguration  as a Sysex file for future use.  You can also use this Sysex file in \nother MIDI programs, not just this software.  \n \nSetup Controls:  \n\u0083 Reset:  Restores the default EWI \nConfiguration . \n\u0083 Load: Loads a previously saved SysEx file \nthat contains Setup Control data only (i.e. \nthe settings from this Setup Controls tab).  \n\u0083 Save:  Saves the current Setup Control \ndata as a SysEx file.  This will save only \nthe settings in this Setup Controls tab.  Because Aria can save so many different \nSysEx files (which affect different settings), \nbe specific when naming your saved files \nso you can recognize what kinds of settings \n(and, therefore, where you can load it) in the future.  \n\u0083 Breath Gain: Determines the gain level of the EWI USB\u2019s breath sensor  in the software.  A higher setting will result in \ngreater sensitivity to your breath.  \n\u0083 Bite Gain: Determines the gain level of both of the bite sensor\u2019s CC assignments except\n for \u201cPitchbend Up-Down\u201d and \n\u201cPitchbend Down-Up,\u201d which is controlled by the Bite AC Gain  (below).  You can select your Bite CC1 and Bite CC2 \nassignments in the Controller Configuration (below).  \n\u0083 Bite AC Gain: Determines the gain level of the bite sensor\u2019s CC assignments \u201cPitchbend Up-Down\u201d and \u201cPitchbend \nDown-Up.\u201d  If \u201cPitchbend Up-Down\u201d or \u201cPitchbend Down-Up\u201d ar e not being used, this setting will have no effect.  All other \nbite sensor CC assignments are controlled by the Bite Gain  (above).  You can select your Bite CC1 and Bite CC2 \nassignments in the Controller Configuration (below).  \n\u0083 Pitch Bend Gain:  Determines the gain level of the EWI USB\u2019s pitch bend plates\u2019 controls in the software.  A higher \nsetting will result in greater pitch bend sensitivity.  You can select your Pitchbend Up Control and Pitchbend Down  \nControl  in the Controller Configuration (below).  A Note About MIDI a nd Some Useful Terms:\nMIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) is not actual music or audio signal but data being transferred.  This data is a \nseries of \u201cevent messages\u201d \u2013 in this case, from the EWI USB to the Aria software \u2013 that controls what note is being \nplayed, what is happening to that note depending on the parameters you select, and what parameters those are. \nThe EWI USB and Aria software were designed to be easy to use, even for players who have never used MIDI before, \nbut here are a few useful MIDI terms that might help you understand this section and how the EWI USB works:  \nSysEx: \u201cSysEx\u201d stands for \u201cSystem Exclusive\u201d \u2013 a file (. syx) containing preset data such as MIDI channels, \ncontroller numbers, parameter settings, etc.  SysEx files can be saved and loaded to recall that preset data.  In \nthe case of the Aria software, the data includes the kinds of settings in this EWI Configuration  section. \nCC: \u201cCC\u201d stands for \u201cContinuous Controller\u201d \u2013 a MIDI message sent from your EWI USB containing a controller \nnumber and a numerical value.  This tells the Aria software how to respond whenever you blow into the EWI \nUSB\u2019s mouthpiece or bite the mouthpiece.  Some common CC assignments include volume, panning, portamento (note \u201cglides\u201d), modulation, and expression.  Advanced MIDI users can freely experiment with CC \nassignments, but for your convenience, the default CC assignments for the EWI USB are the most \u201cintuitive\u201d for \na wind instrument. \nAftertouch:  When you blow into the EWI USB\u2019s mouthpiece, it sends a MIDI message to the software to sound \na note (a \u201cNote-On\u201d message).  Aftertouch is the MIDI data that is sent after you start blowing and while  the \nnote is being played.  Aftertouch is often used to control volume, vibrato, and other parameters.  Some \ninstruments in Aria use Aftertouch while others don\u2019t.  See Breath CC2  under Controller Configuration  for \nmore information. \nNote : You do not have to click \nthe \u201cSave\u201d button to keep these \nsettings in this session.  The EWI \nConfiguration settings will be in \neffect once you close the \nwindow.  If you want to use these \nsettings in a future session, \nthough, you should save them, \njust in cas e.\n \n4  \n\u0083 Key Delay:  Since the EWI USB is electronic and responds to fingering input much faster than an acoustic instrument, \nyou may find it plays extra notes.  This Key Delay  setting determines the reaction time  of the EWI USB\u2019s note keys.  A \nhigher setting will result in a slower ke y response.  (For beginners, we reco mmend a higher setting to  reduce the number \nof note \u201cglitches.\u201d  Most intermediate players can play much cleaner with a setting of 10\u201312.)  \n \nPerformance Controls:  \n\u0083 Reset:  Restores the default EWI \nConfiguration . \n\u0083 Load: Loads only the Performance Control \ndata only from a previously saved SysEx \nfile.  If the file was saved in Aria, it will \ncontain both Performance Control and \nController  Configuration data, but only the \nPerformance Control data will load here.  \n\u0083 Save:  Saves the current Performance \nControl and Controller Configuration data \ntogether as a SysEx file.  This will save only the settings in the Performance Controls \nand Controller Configuration tabs.  Because \nAria can save so many different SysEx files (which affect different settings), be specific when naming your saved files so \nyou can recognize what kinds of settings (and, therefore, where you can load it) in the future.  \n\u0083 MIDI Channel: When an instrument\u2019s channel is set to its own number (instead of -OMNI-), match this MIDI Channel \nwith that number to hear that instrument.  The number of the MIDI Channel setting must\n match the number of the \ninstrument\u2019s channel in order for you to hear it.  (A ny channels set to -OMNI- will be heard regardless of the MIDI \nChannel setting.)  See Channel  under the CHANNELS OVERVIEW  section (below) for more information.  \n\u0083 Transpose: Transposes the notes played by the EWI USB, essentially changing the \u201cconcert\u201d key.  You may transpose \nas much as an octave higher (+12 semitones) or an octave lower (-12 semitones).  This makes it easier to play music \nwritten for an instrument in a different key.  \n\u0083 Fingering: Determines the fingering configuration of the EWI USB in the software.  See the FINGERING CHARTS in the \nEWI USB Quickstart Manual  for more information.  \n \nController Configuration:  \n\u0083 Reset: Restores the default EWI \nConfiguration .  \n\u0083 Load: Loads only the Controller \nConfiguration data from a previously saved \nSysEx file.  If the file was saved in Aria, it will \ncontain both Performance Control and Controller  Configuration data, but only the \nController Configuration data will load here.  \n\u0083 Save:  Saves the current Performance \nControl and Controller Configuration data \ntogether as a SysEx file.  This will save only the settings in the Performance Controls and \nController Configuration tabs.  Because Aria \ncan save so many different SysEx files (which affect different settings), be specific when naming your saved files so you \ncan recognize what kinds of settings (and, therefore, where you can load it) in the future. \n\u0083 Breath CC1: Determines what MIDI data the EWI USB\u2019s breath sensor sends.  The default is \u201cBreath Controller \n(coarse).\u201d  The software is set to have its instruments respond to this setting, so if you change this, the instruments in the \nsoftware will not respond correctly.  \n\u0083 Breath CC2: Determines what MIDI data the EWI USB\u2019s breath sensor sends.  \nThe default is \u201cAftertouch.\u201d  Some of the instruments in the software are set to \nrespond to Aftertouch, so if you change this, the instruments may not respond \ncorrectly.   \n\u0083 Bite CC1: Determines what MIDI data the EWI USB\u2019s bite sensor controls \n(see Performance Controls  above).  The default is \u201cPitchbend Down-Up\u201d \n(vibrato).   \n\u0083 Bite CC2: Determines what MIDI data the EWI USB\u2019s bite sensor controls \n(see Performance Controls  above).  The default is \u201cOFF.\u201d  \n\u0083 Velocity: Specifies the velocity of notes sent from the EWI USB to the \nsoftware (that is, how hard the \u201cattack\u201d of a note is \u2013 not volume).  The default \nis \u201cDynamic.\u201d \n\u0083 Pitchbend Up Control: Determines what MIDI data the EWI USB\u2019s pitch bend-up plate controls.  The default is \n\u201cPitchbend Up.\u201d  \n\u0083 Pitchbend Down Control:  Determines what MIDI data the EWI USB\u2019s pitch bend-down plate controls.  The default is \n\u201cPitchbend Down.\u201d  \nNote : More advanced MIDI \nusers might experiment with the \nCC assignments while using the \nEWI USB in other software.  But \nfor beginners, we recommend \nsticking to the default configurations in Aria (especially \nthe default  Breath CC1 and \nBreath CC2  assignments) since \nthey are the most \u201cintuitive\u201d to \nuse with the EWI USB. \n\n \n5  \n CHANNELS OVERVIEW \n \n \n \n1. Channel: Click here to select either -OMNI- or the number for the corresponding channel.   \n\u0083 Channel Number  (CHN:01, CHN:02, CHN:03, or CHN:04): You can have up to four instruments loaded in the window \nand play only one at a time with the EWI USB.  To do this: \n1) Load an instrument into the channel, then click on the Channel  field and select its number. \n2) Go to the Tools  menu, then EWI Configuration , then Performance Controls . \n3) Click on the MIDI Channel  field and select the same number as the Channel  you want to hear. \nFor instance, if you have the third channel set to its number (CHN:03), you must set the MIDI Channel  to \u201c3\u201d in order to \nhear that it.  (See Performance Controls  above for more information.) \n\u0083 OMNI:  All channels with -OMNI- selected will sound on all MIDI channels.  You can load instruments into multiple \nchannels with -OMNI- selected to hear them sound simultaneously when you play the EWI USB. \n2. Instrument: Click here to assign an instrument to the corresponding channel.  The instruments will be grouped by \u201cfamily\u201d \n(Woodwinds, Brass, Strings, etc.) in submenus.  Choosing \u201cEmp ty\u201d will remove an assigned instrument from that channel.  \nChoosing \u201cImport\u201d will allow you to load an .sfz file (a sample) to use as an in strument sound.   Choosing \u201cReload\u201d will \nrestore the default parameter settings for that instrument (see the PARAMETER WINDOWS section below). \n3. Channel Selector:  Click on the gray circle to the right of the Instrument  field to select that channel.  If an instrument is \nassigned that channel, you should see its pitch range represented on the virtual Keyboard  at the bottom of the window, and \nany applicable parameters will shown will be shown in the right half of the window.  \n4. Parameters:  This area has four different tabs (MIX, CONTROLS, REVERB, and ABOUT) that contain the various \nparameters (volume, panning, reverb, etc.) that you can adjust.   See the PARAMETER WINDOWS section below for more \ninformation. \n5. Keyboard:  The bottom of the window features a virtual Keyboard .  When a channel with an instrument assigned to it is \nselected, a section of the keyboard will be highlighted (the rest will be tinted) to indicate the range of notes that can be \nplayed on that instrument setting.  Notes that are sounding will be tinted within the highlighted section. \n6. Pedals: To the right of the Keyboard  are its pedals.  These pedals serve the same function as those on an acoustic piano \n(from left to right): \n\u0083 The soft or una corda  pedal: Softens the notes being played when pressed. \n\u0083 The sostenuto  pedal: Sustains only the notes that are being played when the pedal is pressed. \n\u0083 The damper  pedal: When pressed, this is the equivalent of a piano\u2019s damper pedal, which sustains any notes being \nplayed and raises the dampers on all the piano\u2019s strings, allowing all other notes to resonate sympathetically with the \nnote(s) being played. \n7. Audio Recorder:  These controls allow you to record your performance on the EWI USB and save it as an audio file on \nyour computer (.WAV for PC users, .AIFF for Mac users).  See the AUDIO RECORDER section below for more \ninformation. 1      2        3            4\n5                           6  \n7\n \n6  \n PARAMETER WINDOWS \n \nNote:  All virtual knobs in the software can be adjusted by holding down the left-click button of your \nmouse and moving it up or down (rather than circular, in the direction of the knob).  Release the button \nto set the level.  An orange line around the knob will indicate how far it is turned, and a box next to it will give a measurement reading.   \n \n MIX \n \nVolume (Vol): This knob controls the volume level of the \ncorresponding channel.   \nPanning (Pan):   This knob controls the left-to-right balance of \nthe audio of the corresponding channel.  The percentage \nreading in the box next to the knob will indicate how much louder the audio is on the right (\u201cR\u201d) or left (\u201cL\u201d).  When in the \ncenter position, the box will show a \u201cC.\u201d  \nReverb:  This knob controls the amount of reverb applied to the \ncorresponding channel.  You can set the kind of reverb you \nwant in the REVERB window (see REVERB section below). \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n CONTROLS \n The parameters available in this window will vary from instrument to instrument, but these are a couple of the most \ncommon ones: \n \nVolume:  This knob indicates the volume level (post-parameter) \nof the corresponding channel. \nTranspose: Transposes the pitch played in the software by the \nnumber of semitones specified her e.  Click the box to show a \nmenu of possible transpositions.  The default is \u201c0,\u201d meaning the \nnote you play on the EWI U SB will sound that note in the \nsoftware.  You may transpose up to an octave higher (+12 \nsemitones) or lower (-12 semitones). ( Note: This only \ntransposes the instrument played in that channel in the software \n\u2013 not the key of the EWI USB.  To change the \u201cconcert\u201d key of \nthe EWI USB, adjust the transposition by going to the  Tools  \nmenu, then  EWI Configuration , then  Performance Controls .) \n \n \n\n \n7  \n REVERB \n  \nPresets:  Click this box to select a reverb preset from a drop-\ndown menu.  The reverb parameters will jump to their preset \npositions.  You can adjust the individual reverb parameter knobs \nyourself, as well. \nStatus:  Click this box to activate and deactivate reverb.  The \nparameter knobs will remain in their respective positions. \n \n\u0084 Reverb Parameters    \nDecay:  Determines the \u201cdecay time,\u201d  or how long the reverb will \ntrail off. \nDiffusion:  Determines how far apart the echoes from the \nreverberating sound are.  The greater the degree of diffusion, \nthe less space there willl be between the echoes. \nSize:  Determines the size of the \u201cvirtual room\u201d in which you are \nplaying.  Higher settings will create longer reverb, emulating the \nacoustics of a larger room. \nPre-Delay:  Determines how soon the reverb begins after the note sounds.  Pre-delay is often what determines our perception \nof space in a room. \nWidth:  Determines the width of the reverb\u2019s stereo image.  \u201c0%\u201d is mono while \u201c100%\u201d is wide stereo.  We recommend setting \nthis close to 100%. \nQuality:  Determines the quality of the reverb.  In general, higher is better, but higher settings require higher CPU usage.  If \nthere is too much demand on your CPU, reduce this setting. \nVariation:  Creates a new variant of the same room (as defined by the \u201cSize\u201d setting).  Adjust this to fine tune the sound of the \nreverb. \nReverb Level:  Determines the volume level of the reverb.  This will not affect the volume level of the original sound. \n ABOUT \n  \nThis screen displays the version of the software and its \ncopyright information as well as \u201clive telemetry\u201d from the \nunderlying software engine.  The information in the left-hand \ncolumn indicates the software\u2019s current CPU usage.  The right-hand column contains the software\u2019s current MIDI events and \nsettings.  You may adjust some of the settings in this window by \nclicking on the box to reveal a drop-down menu: \n \nDyn Max:  Determines the threshold for RAM usage by the \nsoftware.  The default is \u201c256 MB.\u201d \nPre-Caching: Determines how many samples of an instrument \nthe software will process before pl aying them.  A higher setting \nwill result in a slower response, though you should increase this \nsetting if you are using a slower computer.  The default is \u201c32 \nKb.\u201d \nQuality:  Determines audio quality of the playback and \nrecording.  The default is \u201cNormal (Hermite).\u201d \nTuning System: Determines the tuning system of the \ninstrument in the software.  There are different tunings for regions throughout the world, but to start, we recommend the defau lt, \n\u201cInternational 440.\u201d \nInst. Poly: Determines the amount of polyphony (multiple notes sounding simultaneously) the software can play.  A higher \nsetting will allow for greater polyphony but also increase CPU usage.  The default is \u201c32.\u201d \n\n \n8 \n \n AUDIO RECORDER \n \nThe Audio Recorder at the bottom of the screen allows you to record the EWI USB through the software. \n \n       \n \n 1 2 3 \n1.

It lets you play with the expressiveness of an acoustic instrument or the tonal variety and flexibility of an electronic instrument.  Plus, the EWI USB is set up to be used directly with a computer via USB, making it easy to use. \nIn this manual, you\u2019ll find instructions on how to set up the EWI USB and begin making music on it.  For more \ninformation on the included software, we recommend reading the guide on the software DVD.  Enjoy! \n BOX CONTENTS \n\u0083 EWI USB \n\u0083 USB Cable (3m) \n\u0083 Neckstrap \n\u0083 Cleaning cloth \n\u0083 Software DVD \n\u0083 Quickstart Manual \n\u0083 Safety & Warranty Information Booklet \n SOFTWARE OVERVIEW \n \n INSTALLING THE SOFTWARE \n1. Insert the software DVD (included) into your computer\u2019s CD/DVD drive. The setup window should open \nautomatically. \n2. Double-click on Setup  and follow the on-screen instructions to install the software. \n3. Once installation of both the software and samples have successfully completed, you may open the software. \n(No additional driver installation is needed. The computer will install all the necessary drivers automatically.) \n\u0083 Windows (XP or Vista):  You can find the software application in the Program Files  folder or, if \nyou chose to create shortcuts, on the Desktop or in the programs listed in the Start Menu . \n\u0083 Mac:  You can find the software application in the Applications  folder. \n USING THE SOFTWARE \n1. Connect the EWI USB into your computer \nusing a standard USB cable (included). The \nSTATUS LED will light up on the rear panel \n(see #8 in the FEATURES section). \n2. Open the software application. You should \nonly open the software once the EWI USB is connected to your computer, otherwise it may \nnot recognize it. \n3. Under the Tools menu, select Preferences . Then, under MIDI Devices  \ncheck the appropriate box:  \n\u0083 Windows (XP):  Check \u201cUSB Audio Device.\u201d \n\u0083 Windows (Vista) or Mac:  Check \u201cEWI USB.\u201d \nSee the included software guide for more information.  IMPORTANT!  Plugging in the EWI USB \nautomatically recalibrates its keys, rollers, and plates.  \nTo avoid interfering with this process (and causing it to play out of tune), hold the EWI USB only by its \nplastic casing  near the top while plugging it in. \n \n2  \n FEATURES  \n1. MOUTHPIECE \u2013 Place your mouth around this piece \nand blow to play (like a traditional woodwind instrument).  (See BASIC OPERATION and \nMAINTENANCE & CARE for more information.) \n2. NOTE KEYS \u2013 Touch different combinations of these \n13 keys while blowing on the mouthpiece to produce \ndifferent notes.  You can adjust the position of the \nlonger keys by loosening their screws.  (See BASIC OPERATION and FINGERING CHARTS for more information.) \n3. OCTAVE ROLLERS  \u2013 Roll these to shift the basic \nrange played by the NOTE KEYS over three octaves.  Always touch these rollers while playing (see BASIC \nOPERATION).  \n4. GROUND PLATES \u2013 Always touch these plates while \nplaying.  Removing your thumbs from them while \nplaying may reduce the functionality of the EWI USB. \n5. NECKSTRAP MOUNT \u2013  Hang the EWI USB from your \nneck with a neckstrap (included). \n6. PITCH BEND PLATES \u2013  Touch these plates to raise or \nlower the pitch of the note you are playing.  Touch the \nupper (BEND-UP) plate to raise the pitch or the lower (BEND-DOWN) plate to lower it.  You can adjust the position of these plates by loosening their screws and \nsliding them up or down. Do not over-tighten them.  \n7. RESET BUTTON \u2013  Press this button if the EWI USB is \nplaying out of tune or if you encounter a stuck note or problem with the sound module.  This button will reset \nthe EWI USB\u2019s pitch and tell the software to turn \u201call notes off\u201d and \u201creset controllers.\u201d Holding it down will recalibrate the EWI USB\u2019s keys and sensors (see \nKEY/SENSOR RECALIBRATION section for more \ninformation). Hold the EWI USB only by its plastic \ncasing when you press this button.  \n8. STATUS LED \u2013  This light illuminates when the EWI \nUSB is connected to your computer (see SOFTWARE \nOVERVIEW). \n9. USB CONNECTION \u2013  Plug a standard USB cable \n(included) into this jack and into the USB port of your \ncomputer (the STATUS LED will light up).  This connection is used to send and receive MIDI data to and from \nyour computer.  The computer\u2019s USB port will also provide power to the EWI USB. \n \n10. USB CABLE CLIP \u2013  After plugging your USB cable into the USB CONNECTION, clip the cable here so it stays \nsecure while you are playing. \n11. MOISTURE RELEASE VALVE \u2013  Moisture gathered from blowing into the EWI USB empties out of this hole at \nthe bottom of the instrument.  Be careful of where this end of the EWI USB is while playing. \n1\n21\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11FRONT BAC K \nIMPORTANT!  Plugging in the EWI \nUSB automatically recalibrates its keys, rollers, and plates.  To avoid \ninterfering with this process (and causing it to play out of tune), hold the \nEWI USB only by its plastic casing  \nnear the to p while plugging it in.NOTES: \n\u0083 If the EWI USB is shocked by static electricity, unplug \nthe  USB cable from the EWI USB, then reconnect it. \n\u0083 If you experience problems when connecting the EWI \nUSB through a USB hub, we recommend connecting the EWI USB directly to your computer. \n \n3  \n BASIC OPERATION \nFirst, secure the neckstrap to the NECKSTRAP MOUNT on the EWI USB.  Place it \naround your neck and hold the EWI USB the same way you would hold a \nsaxophone or clarinet \u2013 with the instrument vertically right in front of you and with your mouth on the MOUTHPIECE. \nThere are two GROUND PLATES on the back of the EWI USB (one for each hand).  \nYour thumbs should always\n be touching both of these plates to ensure the best \npossible conductivity and performance of the instrument.  Your left thumb should go on top, on the OCTAVE ROLLERS in the back.  Your right thumb should be closer to the bottom, between the PITCH BEND PLATES. \nHere is some essential information on how to play the EWI USB: \nX Mouthpiece\n \nHold the mouthpiece gently in between your lips with your teeth and exhale so your \nbreath is passed through both sides of your mouth.  The EWI USB detects this wind pressure with the breath sensor and expresses the change in sound volume and character, depending on how you blow.  Not a lot of breath should be required to activate the instrument. \nVibrato: There is a vibrato sensor in the mouthpiece.  You can produce a vibrato effect by gently biting the \nmouthpiece, which will bend the pitch down each time you bite.  Do not bite too hard.\n \nTonguing:  You can create small bursts of air by tonguing the mouthpiece for even more expressive control. \nX Note Keys  \nThe note keys are actually touch sensors that let you produce \nsound with only a light touch.  The EWI USB has multiple fingering options that can be set by the software (see FINGERING CHARTS and the guide included in the software \nDVD for more information).  You can adjust the position of the \nlonger keys by loosening the screws that hold each of them in place.  \nX Octave Rollers\n \nPlace your left thumb on the back side of the EWI USB, between any two rollers (and over the GROUND PLATE).  To \nshift the EWI USB\u2019s octave range up or down, slide your thumb up or down across the rollers.  Only the two in the \nmiddle will roll.  The ones on the top and bottom are fixed.  Remove your thumb from the lowest roller to shift it down \nan additional octave.  Remove your thumb from the highest roller to shift it up an additional octave.  \nX Pitch Bend Plates  \nBy touching your thumb to either of these plates, you can move the pitch of the note you are playing up or down. \nTouch the BEND-UP PLATE to raise the pitch or the BEND-DOWN PLATE to lower it. \n MAINTENANCE & CARE \nWe\u2019ve designed the EWI USB to be durable and easy to use, but regular cleaning and maintenance can ensure that it stays in good condition \u2013 and that it will give you the best possible experience while playing it. \n\u0083 When not in use, keep the MOUTHPIECE dry and clean.  You can clean the outer surface with \ndisinfectant alcohol or mild soap and dry it with a soft cloth.  Or, you can remove the screw at the top of the MOUTHPIECE, gently pull it off the body of the EWI USB, and wash just the mouthpiece\n \nin the dishwasher.  \n\u0083 The metal parts on the EWI USB are conductors, so keep them dry and clean to ensure they will \nwork properly whenever you use them.  After playing, wipe the NOTE KEYS, PITCH BEND PLATES, GROUND PLATES, and OCTAVE ROLLERS with a soft, dry cloth. (Over time, natural oils from your hand may slightly tarnish these parts. This is normal and should not be a problem.)  \n\u0083 Moisture gathered from blowing into the instrument empties out of the MOISTURE RELEASE \nVALVE at the very bottom of the EWI USB.  Be careful of where this end of the EWI USB is while playing, and wipe it periodically with a soft, dry cloth.  A NOTE ABOUT KEY RESPONSE:   If the \nEWI USB\u2019s keys, rollers, or plates are not \nvery responsive, it could be because you \nare playing with dry hands (the EWI USB works by using the body\u2019s capacitance).  You may use a very small amount of non-\ngreasy hand lotion to improve the \nconnection between your hands and the keys. \n \n4  \n KEY/SENSOR RECALIBRATION \nIf the EWI USB is not responding as expected (if you are encountering stuck notes, tuning problems, unresponsive \nkeys, etc.), do the following: \n1. Hold the EWI USB by its plastic casing only . Do not touch any of its metal parts. \n2. Press and hold the RESET BUTTON. After five seconds, the STATUS LED will flash rapidly. \n3. When the STATUS LED stops flashing, release the RESET BUTTON. \n UPDATING THE FIRMWARE \n1. While holding down the RESET BUTTON, connect the EWI USB to your computer with the USB cable \n(included).  Be careful not to touch any of the metal keys, plates, and rollers as you do this.  After you see the \nSTATUS LED flash green, you can release the RESET BUTTON. \n2. Download any available firmware updates from http://www.akaipro.com . \n3. The firmware will be a standard MIDI file with a .MID extension.  Play this file with your preferred MIDI file \nplayer (we recommend using Windows Media Player or Quicktime).  Make sure the EWI USB is selected as \nyour application\u2019s MIDI Out port.  As it plays, sending it to the EWI USB, the STATUS LED will turn red. \n4. Once the STATUS LED flashes green again, unplug the EWI USB. \n5. Reconnect the EWI USB.  The STATUS LED will light up red. \n6. Hold the EWI USB by its plastic casing only .  Do not touch any of its metal parts. \n7. Press and hold the RESET BUTTON.  After five seconds, the STATUS LED will flash rapidly. \n8. When the STATUS LED stops flashing, release the RESET BUTTON. \n TROUBLESHOOTING \nPROBLEM CAUSE SOLUTION \nThe LED does not light up \nwhen I plug it in. The EWI USB is not \nproperly connected. Make sure the EWI USB is properly connected to your \ncomputer\u2019s USB port and that the computer is powered on.  If \nnecessary, restart your computer and reconnect the EWI USB. \nThe EWI USB was \nconnected after software \napplication has started. Restart the software application with the EWI USB already \nplugged in. The software does not \nrecognize the EWI USB. \nThe EWI USB is plugged \ninto a USB hub. Unplug the EWI USB from the USB hub and connect directly \nto the computer.  Then close and reopen the software. \nThe volume of your \ncomputer, speakers, or \nheadphones is too low. Increase the volume level of your computer, speakers, or \nheadphones. \nThere is no sound when I \nplay the EWI USB. The software application \nis not set to receive MIDI \ndata from the EWI USB. Make sure the EWI USB is listed as an active MIDI source in \nthe software application (\u201cUSB Audio Device\u201d for Windows XP \nusers or \u201cEWI USB\u201d for Mac or Windows Vista users).  Pull \ndown the Tools  menu and select Preferences  to adjust the \nMIDI settings. \nThere is a conductivity \nproblem with the NOTE \nKEYS. Recalibrate the keys and sensors (see KEY/SENSOR \nRECALIBRATION section above).  Be sure you are not \ntouching any of the keys, rollers, or plates when you press it. A note will not stop \nplaying. \nThere is a problem with \nthe sound module. Close and reopen the software (with the EWI USB still \nplugged in). \nThe keys, rollers, or \nplates are not responsive. There is a conductivity \nproblem with the keys, \nrollers, or plates. Use a very small amount of non-greasy hand lotion to improve \nthe connection between your hands and the keys. \nThe EWI USB is playing \nout of tune. The NOTE KEYS were \nnot properly calibrated \nupon startup. Recalibrate the keys and sensors (see KEY/SENSOR \nRECALIBRATION section above).  Be sure you are not \ntouching any of the keys, rollers, or plates when you press it. \n \n \n \n5 Si experimenta problemas al \nconectar el EWI USB a trav\u00e9s de un hub USB, recomendamos conectarlo \ndirectamente a la \ncomputadora.\n  \n INTRODUCCI\u00d3N \nEste Manual de inicio r\u00e1pido tiene la finalidad de darle una breve descripci\u00f3n general del EWI USB \u2014un vers\u00e1til controlador de instrumentos de viento basado en modelos anteriores de nuestro popular serie EWI (Instrumento de viento electr\u00f3nico) Series.

Sus \npulgares deben tocar siempre  ambas placas para asegurar la mejor conductividad y \nrendimiento posibles del instrumento.  El pulgar izquierdo va arriba, sobre los RODILLOS \nDE OCTAVA de la parte trasera.  El derecho va cerca de la parte inferior, entre las \n PLACAS DE INFLEXI\u00d3N DE PITCH. \nHe aqu\u00ed alguna informaci\u00f3n esencial sobre c\u00f3mo tocar el EWI USB: \nX Boquilla  \nSostenga la boquilla delicadamente entre sus labios con sus diente s y exhale de modo que \nsu aliento pase a trav\u00e9s de ambos lados de su boca.  El EWI USB detecta la presi\u00f3n de \neste viento con el sensor de aliento y expresa el cambio en volumen y car\u00e1cter del sonido, seg\u00fan c\u00f3mo sople.  No se requiere \nmucho aliento para activar el instrumento. \nVibrato: Hay un sensor de vibrato en la boquilla.  Puede producir un efecto de vibrato mordiendo suavemente la \nboquilla, que producir\u00e1 una inflexi\u00f3n de pitch hacia abajo cada vez que muer da.  No muerda demasiado fuerte.  \nAleteo de la punta de la lengua:  Puede crear peque\u00f1as r\u00e1fagas de aire produciendo un aleteo o articulaci\u00f3n de la \npunta de la lengua en la boquilla para l ograr un control a\u00fan m\u00e1s expresivo  \nX Teclas de notas  \nLas teclas de notas son en realidad sensores t\u00e1ctiles que le \npermiten producir sonido con s\u00f3lo un ligero toque.  El EWI USB \ntiene varias opciones de digitaci\u00f3n que se pueden configurar con el \nsoftware (para m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n, consulte TABLAS DE DIGITACI\u00d3N \ny la gu\u00eda incluida en el DVD de software).  Puede ajustar la posici\u00f3n \nde las teclas m\u00e1s largas aflojando los tornillos que las mantienen en \nsu sitio.  \nX Rodillos de octava  \nColoque el pulgar izquierdo sobr e la parte trasera del EWI USB, entre cualquier  par de rodillos (y sobr e la PLACA DE MASA).  \nPara desplazar la gama de octavas del EWI USB hacia arriba o abaj o, deslice su pulgar hacia arriba o abajo a trav\u00e9s de los \nrodillos.  S\u00f3lo girar\u00e1n los dos del medio.  Los de las partes superior e inferior son fijos.  Retire su dedo pulgar de los m\u00e1s bajos \na cambio de rodillo abajo adicionales octava.  Retire su dedo  pulgar de la m\u00e1s alta a cambio de rodillo hasta que una nueva \noctava.  \nX Placas de inflexi\u00f3n de pitch  \nAl tocar con el pulgar cualquiera de estas placas, puede subir o bajar el pitch de la nota que est\u00e1 tocando. Toque la placa \n(BEND-UP) (Subir) para subir el pitch o la inferior (BEND-DOWN) (Bajar) para bajarlo. \n MANTENIMIENTO Y CUIDADO \nHemos dise\u00f1ado el EWI USB para que sea durable y f\u00e1cil de usar, pero la limpieza y el mantenimiento regulares pueden asegurar que se mantenga en buen estado \u2014y que le brinde la mejor experiencia posible mientras toca. \n\u0083 Cuando no est\u00e1 en uso, mantenga la BOQUILLA seca y limpia.  Puede limpiar la superficie exterior con \nalcohol desinfectante o jab\u00f3n suave, y secarla con un pa\u00f1o blando.  Tambi\u00e9n puede retirar el tornillo de la \nparte superior de la BOQUILLA, extraerla  delicadamente del cuerpo del EWI USB y lavar s\u00f3lo la boquilla\n \nen el lavavajilla.  \n\u0083 Las partes met\u00e1licas del EWI USB son conductoras, de modo que debe mantenerlas secas y limpias para \nasegurar que funcionen correctamente cuando las use.  Despu\u00e9s de tocar, restriegue las TECLAS DE \nNOTAS, las PLACAS DE INFLEXI\u00d3N DE PITCH, las PLACAS DE MASA y lo s RODILLOS DE OCTAVA \ncon un pa\u00f1o blando y seco. (A lo largo del tiempo, la grasitud natural de su mano puede ensuciarla. Esto es \nnormal y no deber\u00eda ser un problema).  \n\u0083 La humedad acumulada al soplar en el instrumento se descarga por la V\u00c1LVULA DE DESCARGA DE \nHUMEDAD del extremo inferior del EWI USB.  F\u00edjese con cuidado d\u00f3nde queda este extremo del EWI USB \nmientras toca, y l\u00edmpielo peri\u00f3dicamente con un pa\u00f1o blando y seco.

Vos pouces \ndoivent toujours  toucher ces deux plaques afin d\u2019obteni r la meilleure connectivit\u00e9 et la \nmeilleure performance possible. Votre pouce gauche doit \u00eatre sur le dessus, sur les \nTOUCHES DE TRANSPOSITION D\u2019OCTAVES au dos . Votre pouce droit doit \u00eatre plus \nbas, entre les PLAQUES DE VARIATION TONALE. \nVoici des informations essentielles afin de pouvoir jouer le EWI USB : \nX Embouchure  \nTenez d\u00e9licatement l\u2019embouchure entre vos l\u00e8vres avec vos dents et soufflez pour que le \nsouffle passe par les deux extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s de votre bouche. Le EWI USB d\u00e9tecte la pression de \nsouffle par son capteur et exprime le changement en termes de volume et de caract\u00e8re de \nson. Il n\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de souffler  tr\u00e8s fort afin d\u2019activer l\u2019instrument \nVibrato : L\u2019embouchure poss\u00e8de un capteur de vibrato. Vous pouvez produire un effet de vibrato en mordant \nd\u00e9licatement l\u2019embouchure, ce qui a pour effet de diminuer la hauteur chaque fois que vous mordez. Ne mordez pas \ntrop fort.  \nEffet de langue :  Vous pouvez cr\u00e9er de petites salves d\u2019air par effet de langue dur l\u2019embouchure pour contr\u00f4le encore \nplus expressif. \nX Touches des notes  \nLes touches des notes vous permettent de produire des sons \navec un toucher l\u00e9ger. Le EWI USB \u00e0 plusieurs options de doigt\u00e9 \nqui peuvent \u00eatre r\u00e9gl\u00e9es dans le logiciel (voir TABLATURE et le guide sur le DVD pour plus d\u2019information). Vous pouvez r\u00e9gler la \nposition des touches plus longues en desserrant les vis qui les \nretiennent.  \nX Galets de transposition d\u2019octave\n  \nPlacez votre pouce gauche \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du EWI USB, entre deux galets quelconques (et sur la PRISE DE TERRE). Pour \naugmenter ou diminuer la plage d\u2019octave, faites glisser votre pouce vers le haut ou vers le bas sur les galets. Uniquement les deux du milieu rouler ont. Ceux du haut et du bas sont fixes. Retirez votr e pouce le plus bas de galet de d\u00e9placer vers le bas \nune octave suppl\u00e9mentaire.  Retirez votre pouce du plus haut de galet de d\u00e9placer vers le haut une octave suppl\u00e9mentaire.   \nX Plaques de variation tonale\n \nEn touchant avec votre pouce \u00e0 une des deux plaques, vous  pouvez augmenter ou diminuer la variation tonale de la note \njou\u00e9e. Touchez la plaque sup\u00e9rieure (BEND-UP) pour augmenter la hauteur tonale ou la plaque inf\u00e9rieure (BEND-DOWN) pour \nla diminuer. \n ENTRETIEN ET NETTOYAGE \nNous avons con\u00e7u le EWI USB afin qu\u2019il soit durable et facile d\u2019entretien, mais un entretien et un nettoyage r\u00e9gulier assurent qu\u2019il demeure en bonne condition et qu\u2019il vous procure la meilleure exp\u00e9rience possible. \n\u0083 Lorsque vous ne l\u2019utilisez pas, assurez-vous que l\u2019EMBOUCHURE soit s\u00e8che et propre.

Nel menu Strumenti, scegliere Opzioni . Quindi, sotto Dispositivi MIDI,  \nspuntare la casella corretta:  \n\u0083 Windows (XP):  spuntare \u201cUSB Audio Device\u201d (periferica audio USB).  \n\u0083 Windows (Vista) o Mac:  spuntare \u201cEWI USB\u201d.  \nSi veda la guida al software per maggiori informazioni.  IMPORTANTE! Collegando il EWI USB, questo \nricalibra automaticamente tasti, roller e piastre. Per \nevitare di interferire con questo processo (e di farlo suonare fuori tonalit\u00e0), reggere l\u2019EWI USB \nunicamente per la parte superiore del suo \nalloggiamento in plastic aal momento di colle garlo. \n \n14  \n CARATTERISTICHE  \n1. BOCCHINO \u2013 Appoggiare le labbra a questo pezzo e \nsoffiare per suonare (come un normale strumento a \nfiato). (Si veda FUNZIONAMENTO BASE e \nMANUTENZIONE E CURA per maggiori informazioni.)  \n2. TASTI NOTA  \u2013 Toccare diverse combinazioni di questi \n13 tasti mentre si soffia nel bocchino per produrre le \nvarie note. Si pu\u00f2 regolare la posizione dei tasti pi\u00f9 lunghi allentandone le viti.  (Si veda FUNZIONAMENTO BASE e SCHEMI DI \nDITEGGIATURA per maggiori informazioni.)\n \n3. OCTAVE ROLLER  \u2013 Girarli per modificare la gamma \nbase suonata dai TASTI NOTA di tre ottave. Toccare \nsempre i roller mentre si suona (si veda \nFUNZIONAMENTO BASE).  \n4. PIASTRE DI TERRA \u2013 Toccare sempre queste piastre \nmentre si suona. Togliere i pollici dalle piastre mentre si \nsuona pu\u00f2 ridurre la funzionalit\u00e0 dell\u2019EWI USB.  \n5. FESSURA PER FASCETTA DA COLLO \u2013  Appendere \nl\u2019EWI USB al collo servendosi di una fascetta (in \ndotazione). \n6. PIASTRE PITCH \u2013  Toccare queste piastre per alzare o \nabbassare il pitch della nota che si sta suonando. \nToccare la piastra superiore (BEND-UP) per alzare il pitch o quella inferiore (BEND-DOWN) per abbassarlo. Si pu\u00f2 regolare la posizione di queste piastre allentandone le viti e facendole scorrere verso l\u2019alto o \nverso il basso. Non serrarle eccessivamente.\n \n7. TASTO RESET \u2013  Premere questo tasto se l\u2019EWI USB \nsta suonando fuori tonalit\u00e0 o in caso di note bloccate o \naltri problemi con il modulo sonoro. Questo tasto \nazzerer\u00e0 il pitch dell\u2019EWI USB e dir\u00e0 al software di \n\u201cspegnere tutte le note\u201d e di \u201cazzerare i controller\u201d. Tenendolo premuto verranno ricalibrati i tasti e i sensori dell\u2019EWI USB (per maggiori informazioni, si veda \nRICALIBRAZIONE TASTI / SENSORE).  Reggere \nl\u2019EWI USB solo per il suo alloggiamento in plastica quando si preme questo tasto. \n \n8. LED di STATO \u2013  Questo si accende quando l\u2019EWI \nUSB \u00e8 collegato al computer (si veda PANORAMICA \nDEL SOFTWARE). \n9. PORTA USB \u2013  Inserire un cavo standard USB (in \ndotazione) a livello di questa presa e nella porta USB \ndel computer (il LED di STATO si accender\u00e0). Questo collegamento serve a inviare e ricevere dati MIDI da e \nverso il computer. La porta USB del computer fornir\u00e0 inoltre alimentazione all\u2019EWI USB. \n \n10. CLIP CAVO USB \u2013  Dopo aver collegato il cavo USB nella PORTA USB, fissarlo a questo livello in modo che \nrimanga ben saldo mentre si suona.  \n11.

Prestare attenzione a dove si trova questo capo \ndell\u2019EWI USB mentre si suona.  \n1\n21\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11  FRONTE                RETRO \nIMPORTANTE! Collegando il EWI USB, \nquesto ricalibra automaticamente tasti, \nroller e piastre. Per evitare di interferire con \nquesto processo (e di farlo suonare fuori tonalit\u00e0), reggere l\u2019EWI USB unicamente \nper la parte superiore del suo alloggiamento \nin plastica  al momento di collegarlo. NOTE:\n\u0083 Se l\u2019EWI USB subisce una scossa di elettricit\u00e0 \nelettrostatica, scollegare il cavo USB dall\u2019EWI USB, \nquindi ricollegarlo . \n\u0083 In caso di problemi al momento di collegare l\u2019EWI USB \ntramite un hub USB, si raccomanda di collegare l\u2019EWI \nUSB direttamente al com puter.\n \n15  \n FUNZIONAMENTO BASE \nInnanzitutto, fissare la fascetta da collo all\u2019apposita FESSURA sull\u2019EWI USB. Porla \nintorno al collo e reggere l\u2019EWI USB allo stesso modo in cui si reggerebbe un sassofono o un clarinetto: con lo strumento verticale di fronte a voi e le labbra sul BOCCHINO. \n \nSul retro dell\u2019EWI USB vi sono due PIASTRE DI TERRA (una per ciascuna mano).  \nI pollici devono sempre  essere in contatto con entrambe la piastre per garantire la \nmigliore conduttivit\u00e0 possibile e le migliori prestazioni dello strumento. Il pollice sinistro deve stare sopra, sugli OCTAVE ROLLER sul retro. Il pollice destro si deve trovare pi\u00f9 vicino al fondo, tra le PIASTRE PITCH BEND.\n \nEcco alcune informazioni essenziali su come suonare l\u2019EWI USB: \nX Bocchino  \nReggere delicatamente il bocchino tra le labbra con i denti ed espirare in modo che \nl\u2019aria passi attraverso entrambi i lati della bocca. L\u2019EWI USB percepisce questa pressione dell\u2019aria tramite il sensore del respiro ed esprime il cambiamento sotto forma di volume sonoro e colore, a seconda di come si soffia. Per attivare lo strumento non dovrebbe essere necessaria una quantit\u00e0 eccessiva di soffio.\n \nVibrato: il bocchino contiene un sensore del vibrato. Si pu\u00f2 produrre un effetto vibrato mordendo \ndelicatamente il bocchino: ad ogni morso, il pitch verr\u00e0 abbassato. Non mordere troppo.  \nUso della lingua:  si possono creare piccoli soffi d\u2019aria utilizzando la lingua per un controllo espressivo ancora \nmaggiore.  \nX Tasti nota  \nI tasti nota sono sensori di tocco che permettono di produrre \nsuoni con un leggero tocco. L\u2019EWI USB presenta numerose opzioni di diteggiatura che possono essere impostate dal \nsoftware (per maggiori informazioni, si vedano gli SCHEMI DI \nDITEGGIATURA e la guida inclusa nel DVD recante il software). Si pu\u00f2 regolare la posizione dei tasti pi\u00f9 lunghi allentando le viti che li fissano in posizione. \n \nX Octave Roller  \nPosizionare il pollice sinistro a livello della parte posteriore dell\u2019EWI USB, tra due roller (e sulla PIASTRA DI TERRA).  \nPer abbassare o alzare la gamma di ottave dell\u2019EWI USB, far scorrere il pollice verso il basso o verso l\u2019alto lungo i \nroller. Solo i due al centro ruotano. Quelli superiore e inferiore sono fissi. Rimuovere il pollice il pi\u00f9 basso dal roller di spostare verso il basso un ulteriore ottava.  Rimuovere il pollice il pi\u00f9 alto dal roller di trasferimento e un ulteriore istituto ottava.  \n \nX Piastre  Pitch Bend  \nToccando con il pollice una di queste piastre, si pu\u00f2 alzare o abbassare il pitch della nota che si sta suonando. \nToccare la piastra superiore (BEND-UP) per alzare il pitch o quella inferiore (BEND-DOWN) per abbassarlo.  \n MANUTENZIONE E CURA \nAbbiamo progettato l\u2019EWI USB in modo che sia robusto e facile da usare, ma una pulizia ed una manutenzione regolari possono garantire che rimanga in buone condizioni e che vi offra le migliori prestazioni quando lo suonate.  \n\u0083 Quando non \u00e8 in uso, mantenere il BOCCHINO asciutto e pulito. Si pu\u00f2 pulire la superficie esterna \ncon alcol disinfettante o sapone delicato e asciugarla con un panno morbido. Oppure, si pu\u00f2 \nrimuovere la vite posta sulla parte superiore del BOCCHINO, estrarlo delicatamente dal corpo \ndell\u2019EWI USB, e lavare solo il bocchino stesso  in lavastoviglie.  \n\u0083 Le parti metalliche dell\u2019EWI USB sono conduttori, quindi vanno mantenute asciutte e pulite per \ngarantire che funzionino correttamente ogniqualvolta vengono utilizzate. Dopo aver suonato, pulire i TASTI NOTA, le PIASTRE PITCH BEND, le PIASTRE DI TERRA e gli OCTAVE ROLLER con un \npanno morbido e asciutto. (Nel tempo, gli oli naturali presenti sulle mani possono macchiare \nleggermente queste parti. Ci\u00f2 \u00e8 normale e non dovrebbe rappresentare un problema.) \n\u0083 L\u2019umidit\u00e0 raccolta con il soffiare nello strumento viene drenata dalla VALVOLA DI SFOGO \nDELL\u2019UMIDIT\u00c0 posta sul fondo dell\u2019EWI USB. Prestare attenzione a dove si trova questo capo \ndell\u2019EWI USB quando si suona e pulirlo periodicamente con un panno morbido e asciutto.  NOTA IN MERITO ALLA RISPOSTA DEI \nTASTI:  se i tasti, i roller o le piastre dell\u2019EWI \nUSB non sono molto reattivi, ci\u00f2 pu\u00f2 essere \ndovuto al fatto che state suonando con mani \nsecche (l\u2019EWI USB funziona servendosi della capacitanza corporea). Ci si pu\u00f2 servire di una leggera quantit\u00e0 di lozione non unta per le mani per migliorare il \ncontatto tra le mani e i tasti. \n \n16  \n RICALIBRAZONE TASTI/SENSORE \nSe l\u2019EWI USB non risponde come dovrebbe (si verificano note bloccate, problemi di sintonia, tasti che non \nrispondono, ecc.), procedere come segue: \n1. Reggere l\u2019EWI USB unicamente per l\u2019alloggiamento in plastica . Non toccare le sue parti metalliche.  \n2. Tenere premuto il TASTO RESET. Dopo cinque secondi, il LED di STATO lampegger\u00e0 rapidamente.  \n3. Quando il LED di STATO smette di lampeggiare, lasciare il TASTO RESET. \n AGGIORNAMENTO DEL FIRMWARE \n1. Tenendo premuto il TASTO RESET, collegare l\u2019EWI USB al computer servendosi del cavo USB (in dotazione).  \nPrestare attenzione a non toccare i tasti metallici, piastre e roller mentre si fa questo. Quando il LED di STATO \u00e8 diventato verde, si pu\u00f2 lasciare la pressione dal TASTO RESET. \n2. Scaricare eventuali aggiornamenti del firmware disponibili dalla pagina http://www.akaipro.com . \n3. Il firmware sar\u00e0 un file MIDI standard con estensione .MID.

Wenn die Installation der Software sowie der Samples erfolgreich abgeschlossen wurde, k\u00f6nnen Sie die \nSoftware starten. (Zus\u00e4tzliche Treiber m\u00fcssen Sie nicht installieren. Der Computer installiert alle notwendigen Treiber automatisch.) \n\u0083 Windows (XP oder Vista):  Sie finden das Programm im Programme Ordner oder, falls Sie einen \nShortcut erstellt haben, auf dem Desktop oder in den Programmen, die im Start Men\u00fc \naufgelistet sind. \n\u0083 Mac:  Sie finden das Programm im Ordner Programme . \n VERWENDUNG DER SOFTWARE \n1. Verbinden Sie das EWI USB mittels eines \nnormalen USB Kabels (im Lieferumfang). Die \nSTATUS LED auf der R\u00fcckseite (siehe #8 im \nAbschnitt \u00dcBERBLICK) leuchtet. \n2. \u00d6ffnen Sie die Software. Sie sollten die \nSoftware erst dann \u00f6ffnen, nachdem Sie das EWI USB an den Computer angeschlossen \nhaben, da das Ger\u00e4t sonst nicht erkannt wird. \n3. W\u00e4hlen Sie im Tools Men\u00fc Preferences . W\u00e4hlen Sie im MIDI \nDevices  Men\u00fc das EWI USB aus:  \n\u0083 Windows (XP):  Markieren Sie \u201cUSB Audio Device.\u201d \n\u0083 Windows (Vista) oder Mac:  Markieren Sie \u201cEWI USB.\u201d \nBeachten Sie die Software Anleitung f\u00fcr weitere Informationen.  WICHTIG!  Beim Anschlie\u00dfen des EWI USB werden \nautomatisch die Tasten, Rollers und Plates \nrekalibriert.  Um diesen Vorgang nicht zu st\u00f6ren \n(wodurch das Ger\u00e4t in der falschen Stimmung spielen k\u00f6nnte), halten Sie das EWI USB nur oberen Bereich \ndes Plastikgeh\u00e4uses,  wenn Sie es anschlie\u00dfen. \n \n18  \n \u00dcBERBLICK \n1. MUNDST\u00dcCK \u2013 Blasen Sie in das Mundst\u00fcck (wie bei \neinem normalen Blasinstrument).  (Siehe BEDIENUNG und \nPFLEGEHINWEISE f\u00fcr weitere Informationen.) \n2. NOTENTASTEN \u2013 Ber\u00fchren Sie Kombinationen dieser 13 \nTasten, w\u00e4hrend Sie in das Mundst\u00fcck blasen, um verschiedene Noten zu spielen.  Sie k\u00f6nnen sie Position \nder l\u00e4ngeren tasten anpassen. Dazu l\u00f6sen Sie die Schrauben der Tasten.  (Siehe BEDIENUNG und PFLEGEHINWEISE f\u00fcr weitere Informationen.) \n3. OCTAVE ROLLERS  \u2013 Drehen Sie diese Roller, um den \nStandardbereich, in dem sie NOTENTASTEN spielen, um \nbis zu drei Oktaven zu verschieben.  Ber\u00fchren Sie diese Rollers beim Spielen (siehe BEDIENUNG).  \n4. GROUND PLATES \u2013 Ber\u00fchren Sie beim Spielen immer \ndiese Plates.  Falls Sie die Daumen beim Spielen von den \nPlates weg bewegen, reduzieren Sie damit den Funktionsumfang des EWI USB. \n5. NACKENGURT HALTER \u2013  H\u00e4ngen Sie sich das EWI USB \nmit dem Nackengurt um den Hals (beiliegend). \n6. PITCH BEND PLATES \u2013  Ber\u00fchren Sie diese Plates, um \ndie Tonh\u00f6he der Note, die Sie spielen, zu erh\u00f6hen oder \nabzusenken.  Ber\u00fchren Sie die obere (BEND-UP) Plate, \num die Tonh\u00f6he anzuheben die untere (BEND-DOWN) Plate, um sie abzusenken.  Sie k\u00f6nnen die Position dieser Plates anpassen, indem Sie die Schrauben l\u00f6sen und die Plates verschieben. Ziehen Sie danach die Schrauben \nnicht zu fest an.  \n7. RESET TASTE \u2013  Dr\u00fccken Sie diese Taste, falls das EWI \nUSB verstimmt spielt oder wenn Sie h\u00e4ngende Noten bzw. \nein Problem mit dem Sound Modul haben.  Diese Taste \ninitialisiert die Tonh\u00f6he des EWI USB und sendet zur \nSoftware \u201cAll Notes Off\u201d und \u201cReset Controllers\u201d Befehle.  Halten Sie die Taste gedr\u00fcckt, werden die Tasten und Sensoren des EWI USB zur\u00fcckgesetzt (siehe \nTASTEN/SENSOR REKALIBRIERUNG f\u00fcr weitere \nInformationen). Halten Sie das EWI USB nur am \nPlastikgeh\u00e4use fest, wenn Sie diese Taste dr\u00fccken..  \n8. STATUS LED \u2013  Diese LED leuchtet, wenn das EWI USB \nmit Ihrem Computer verbunden ist (siehe SOFTWARE \u00dcBERBLICK). \n9. USB ANSCHLUSS \u2013  Verbinden Sie das EWI USB mit einem normalen USB Kabel \u00fcber diesen USB \nAnnschluss mit einem freien USB Port Ihres Computers (die STATUS LED leuchtet bei erfolgreichem \nAnschluss).  Diese Verbindung wird zum Senden und zum Empfang von MIDI Daten von und zum Computer \nverwendet.  Der USB Port des Computers stellt auch die Spannungsversorgung des EWI USB bereit. \n \n10. USB KABELBEFESTIGUNG \u2013  Nachdem Sie die USB Kabelverbindung hergestellt haben, k\u00f6nnen Sie das \nKabel hier befestigen, damit es beim Spielen nicht versehentlich herausgezogen wird. \n11. FL\u00dcSSIGKEITSABLEITUNG \u2013  Fl\u00fcssigkeit, die beim Spielen in das EWI USB gelangt, wird \u00fcber diesen Kanal \nnach au\u00dfen gef\u00fchrt.  Achten Sie auf diese Ableitung, w\u00e4hrend Sie das EWI USB spielen. WICHTIG!  Beim Anschlie\u00dfen des EWI \nUSB werden automatisch die Tasten, \nRollers und Plates rekalibriert.  Um diesen Vorgang nicht zu st\u00f6ren (wodurch \ndas Ger\u00e4t in der falschen Stimmung \nspielen k\u00f6nnte), halten Sie das EWI USB \nnur oberen Bereich des \nPlastikgeh\u00e4uses,  wenn Sie es \nanschlie\u00dfen. \n1\n21\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11             VORN              ZUR\u00dcCK \nHINWEIS:\n\u0083 Falls der EWI USB statisch aufgeladen wird, \nunterbrechen Sie die USB Verbindung und stecken Sie nach einer Weile das USB Kabel \nwieder am EWI USB an. \n\u0083 Sollten Sie Probleme beim Anschluss des EWI \nUSB \u00fcber einen USB Hub haben, empfehlen wir, \ndass Sie das EWI USB direkt mit dem Computer \nverbinden.\n \n19  \n BEDIENUNG \nBefestigen Sie zun\u00e4chst den Nackengurt mit dem NACKENGURT HALTER des EWI \nUSB.  Legen Sie den Gurt um Ihren Hals und halten Sie das EWI USB in der gleichen \nWeise, wie Sie auch ein Saxofon oder eine Klarinette halten w\u00fcrden. \nAuf der R\u00fcckseite des EWI U SB befinden sich zwei GROUND PLATES (eine f\u00fcr jede \nHand).  Ihre Daumen sollten immer  beide Plates ber\u00fchren, um zu gew\u00e4hrleisten, dass \ndas Instrument die optimale Performance liefert.  Ihr linker Daumen sollte die obere \nPlate, nahe der OCTAVE ROLLER S liegen.  Ihr rechter Daumen sollte n\u00e4her am Ende \ndes Instruments, zwischen den PITCH BEND PLATES, liegen. \nNachfolgend finden Sie ein paar grundlegende Informationen zum Spielen des EWI USB: \nX Mundst\u00fcck  \nHalten Sie das Mundst\u00fcck leicht zwischen Ihren Lippen mit den Z\u00e4hnen und atmen Sie \nso aus, dass Ihr Atem aus beiden Seiten Ihres Mundes austritt.   Das EWI USB erkennt \ndie Blasst\u00e4rke mit dem Breath Sensor und \u00e4ndert demzufolge die Soundlautst\u00e4rke und \nden -charakter.  Sie sollten nicht viel Anblasdruck ben\u00f6tigen, um das Instrument spielen \nzu k\u00f6nnen. \nVibrato: Im Mundst\u00fcck befindet sich ein Vibrato Sensor. Indem Sie vorsichtig auf das Mundst\u00fcck bei\u00dfen, erzeugen Sie \neinen Vibrato Effekt. Bei\u00dfen Sie nicht zu fest zu, da Sie sonst das Mundst\u00fcck und den innenliegenden Sensor zerst\u00f6ren.  \nTonguing:  Wenn Sie das Mundst\u00fcck mit der Zunge anschlagen, leiten Sie Luftsch\u00fcbe in das Mundst\u00fcck, wodurch der \nSound besonders ausdrucksstark wird. \nX Note Tasten  \nDie Note Tasten mit Touch Sensoren lassen den Sound mit einer \nleichten Ber\u00fchrung entstehen. Das EWI USB kann mit mehreren \nFingers\u00e4tzen, die Sie in der Software einstellen k\u00f6nnen, umgehen \n(siehe FINGERSATZ\u00dcBERSICHT und die Anleitung auf der Software DVD f\u00fcr weitere Informationen).  Sie k\u00f6nnen die Position der \nl\u00e4ngeren Tasten \u00e4ndern, indem Sie die Schrauben l\u00f6sen, durch die \ndiese Tasten in Position gehalten werden.  \nX Octave Rollers\n \nLegen Sie Ihren linken Daumen auf der Un terseite des EWI USB, zwischen zwei Rollers und \u00fcber die GROUND PLATE. Um \nden Oktavbereich des EWI USB zu \u00e4ndern, schieben Sie Ihren Daumen \u00fcber die Rollers. Nur die beiden Rollers in der Mitte rollen auch wirklich. Entfernen Sie Ihren Daumen aus dem niedrigsten Rollen zu verlagern sie eine zus\u00e4tzliche Oktave.  \nEntfernen Sie Ihren Daumen aus der h\u00f6chsten Rollen zu verlagern sie eine zus\u00e4tzliche Oktave. \nX Pitch Bend Plates\n \nIn dem Sie eine dieser Plates mit einem Daumen ber\u00fchren, k\u00f6nnen Sie die Tonh\u00f6he einer gerade gespielten Note nach oben \noder unten beugen. Die BEND-UP PLATE erh\u00f6ht die Tonh\u00f6he und die BEND-DOWN PLATE verringert die Tonh\u00f6he. \n PFLEGEHINWEISE \nDas EWI USB ist zwar auf Langlebigkeit hin entwickelt worden, regelm\u00e4\u00dfiges Reinigen und Pflegen gew\u00e4hrleistet, dass Sie das Instrument \u00fcber viele Jahre einsetzen k\u00f6nnen. \n\u0083 Falls das EWI USB nicht in Verwen dung ist, sollten Sie das MUNDST\u00dcCK trocken und sauber  lagern.  Sie \nk\u00f6nnen die \u00e4u\u00dfere Oberfl\u00e4che mit einem desinfizierenden Alkohol oder einer milden Seife reinigen und mit \neinem weichen Tuch abtro cknen.  Sie k\u00f6nnen auch di e Schraube im oberen Mundst\u00fcckber eich l\u00f6 sen und \ndas MUNDST\u00dcCK vorsichtig aus dem EWI USB ziehen und nur das Mundst\u00fcck\n im Geschirrsp\u00fcler reinigen.  \n\u0083 Die Metallteile des EWI USB sind leitf\u00e4hig. Achten Sie also darauf, dass sie trocken und sauber sind, damit \nsie richtig funktionieren.  Nach dem Sie gespielt haben, reiben Sie die NOTE TASTEN, PITCH BEND \nPLATES, GROUND PLATES und OCTAVE ROLLERS mi t einem weichen, trockenem Tuch ab. (\u00dcber \nl\u00e4ngere Dauer kann sich durch die Benutzung ein leichter Beschlag auf diesen Teilen festsetzen. Das ist normal und sollte kein Problem darstellen.)  \n\u0083 Speichelfl\u00fcssigkeit, die durch das Spielen in das Instrument gelangt, l\u00e4uft an der \nFL\u00dcSSIGKEITSABLEITUNG am unteren Ende des EWI USB aus. Achten Sie auf diese Ableitung, w\u00e4hrend \nSie das EWI USB spielen und reinigen Sie diese regelm\u00e4\u00dfig mit einem weichen, trockenem Tuch.  EIN HINWEIS ZUR REAKTION DER TASTEN :  \nSollten die Tasten, Rollers oder Plates des EWI \nUSB nicht richtig reagieren, k\u00f6nnte das an zu \ntrockenen H\u00e4nden liegen (das EWI USB ragiert \nauf die Leitf\u00e4higkeit des K\u00f6rpers). Verwenden Sie etwas nicht fettende Handlotion, um die \nLeitf\u00e4higkeit zwischen Ihren H\u00e4nden und den \nTasten zu verbessern. \n \n20  \n TASTEN/SENSOR REKALIBRIERUNG  \nSollte das EWI USB sich nicht wie erwartet spielen lassen oder beim Auftreten von h\u00e4ngenden Noten, Stimmproblemen, nicht \nfunktionierenden Tasten, usw., gehen Sie bitte wie folgt vor: \n1. Halten Sie das EWI USB nur am Plastikgeh\u00e4use fest . Ber\u00fchren Sie keine der Metallteile. \n2. Halten Sie die RESET TASTE gedr\u00fcckt. Nach f\u00fcnf  Sekunden blinkt die STATUS LED mehrmals. \n3. Wenn die STATUS LED aufh\u00f6rt zu blinken, lassen Sie die RESET TASTE los. \n AKTUALISIEREN DER FIRMWARE \n1. Schlie\u00dfen Sie das EWI USB mit dem beiliegenden USB Kabel an den Computer an und halten Sie dabei die RESET \nTASTE gedr\u00fcckt.  Achten Sie darauf, dass Sie dabei keine Metallteile, wie die Metalltasten, Plates und Rollers ber\u00fchren.  \nWenn Sie sehen, dass die STATUS LED gr\u00fcn blinkt, k\u00f6nnen Sie die RESET Taste loslassen. \n2. Laden Sie sich die neue Firmware von der Webseite http://www.akaipro.com  herunter. \n3. Die Firmware ist ein Standard MIDI File mit der Dateiendung .MID.  Spielen Sie diese Datei mit einer MIDI File Player \nSoftware (Windows Media Player oder Quicktime) ab.  Achten Sie dabei darauf, dass das EWI USB in der Software als MIDI Out definiert ist.  W\u00e4hrend des \u00dcberspielens der Firmware in das EWI USB leuchtet die STATUS LED rot. \n4. Wenn die STATUS LED wieder gr\u00fcn blinkt, k\u00f6nnen Sie die Verbindung zwischen EWI USB und Computer trennen. \n5. Stellen Sie die Verbindung zum EWI USB wieder her.  Die STATUS LED leuchtet rot. \n6. Halten Sie das EWI USB nur am Plastikgeh\u00e4use fest\n. Ber\u00fchren Sie keine der Metallteile. \n7. Halten Sie den RESET TASTE gedr\u00fcckt.  Nach 5 Sekunden blinkt die STATUS LED wiederholt auf. \n8. Wenn das Blinken der STATUS LED stop pt, lassen Sie den RESET TASTE los. \n FEHLERHILFE \nPROBLEM URSACHE L\u00d6SUNG \nDie LED leuchtet nicht, \nwenn ich das Ger\u00e4t \nanschlie\u00dfe.

At Akai Professional, we know how serious music is to you. That\u2019s why we \ndesign our equipment with only one thing in mind\u2014to make your performance the best it can be. \n \nSupport \n \nFor the latest information about this product (documentation , technical specifications, system  requirements, compatibility \ninformation, etc.) and product registration, visit akaipro.com . \nFor additional product support, visit akaipro.com /support . \n \nGetting Started \n \nImportant \n Before operating the EWI Solo , please note the following: \n\u2022 Do not bite the mouthpiece too hard \u2014this can damage the vibrato sensor. Use the mouthpiece cover after \nusing or while carrying the EWI Solo. \n\u2022 Always touch the grounding plate and octave rollers when playing. These are sensors which use the \nperformer's body as the ground. \n\u2022 Keep the mouthpiece clean  before, during, and after using the EWI Solo. You can clean its outer surface with a \nslightly damp cloth. \n \n1. Power the EWI Solo \n \nThe EWI Solo is powered by a rechargeable battery. Please note the following about using it: \n\u2022 Charging:  Use the included USB cable to connect the EWI Solo's USB port to either (A) the included USB power \nadapter, connected to a power source or (B) an available USB port on your computer (powered on). You can \ncharge the battery while using the EWI Solo. While charging, the Power LED will blink slowly. \n\u2022 Power:  EWI Solo will power on automatically when connected to USB. To power on EWI Solo when not connected \nto USB, press the Power button. To power off EWI Solo, press and hold the power button for one second. \n\u2022 Battery life:  Check the battery life by viewing battery icon in the lower right corner of the display. Turn or press \nthe encoder to activate the display, if necessary. \n\u2022 Low-battery warning:  When the battery power is low and EWI Solo is not connected to USB, the Power LED \nwill flash quickly and the battery icon in  the display will blink to indicate th at you should char ge the battery. \n\u2022 Auto-power-off:  If the EWI Solo detects no activity for approximately 30 minutes , it will power off automatically. \nYou can disable this option in the Global Menu. In general, though, power off the EWI Solo to preserve its \nbattery life when you are not using it. \nSee Operation > Other Functions > Rechargeable Battery  for more information. \n \n2. Hold the EWI Solo \n 1. Secure the neck strap to the EWI Solo's neck strap mount. \n2. Place the strap around your neck and hold the EWI Solo with your left hand on the upper \nkeys and your right hand on the lower keys, with the instrument vertically right in front of you \nand the bell (speaker) pointed down. \n3. When playing, place your left thumb on the octave rollers in the back, and place your right thumb between the thumb-hook an d pitch-bend plate. This will  ensure the best possible \nconductivity and performance of the instrument.  \n \n \n4  \n3. Connect \n \nImportant:  The scenarios below are not mutually exclusive. The EWI Solo can send out audio from its Line Out , from \nits Phones  jack, and through the built-in speaker  all at the same time . The exception is when the EWI Solo is \nconnected to your computer an d powered off (the third scenario in this se ction): it will send MI DI messages to your \ncomputer but not send any audio. To disable the built-in speaker, use the  Global Menu . \n \n \nTo play EWI Solo's audio through an external amplifier, audio interface, etc.:\n1. Use a standard 1/4\" (6.35 mm) cable to connect the EWI Solo's Line Out  to \nthe line-level input of your keyboard amplifier, audio interface, etc. \nImportant: The Line Out  is a mono output. Use a TS or TRS cable to \nconnect to a mono input (like those on most keyboard amplifiers, audio \ninterfaces, etc.). \n2. Press the EWI Solo's Power Button  to power it on. \n \n \n \n  \nTo play EWI Solo's audio through headphones: \n1. Connect standard 1/8\" (3.5 mm) stereo headphones to EWI Solo's Phones\njack. \n2. Press the EWI Solo's Power Button  to power it on. \n To play EWI Solo as a \"wired\" MIDI controller:\n1. Make sure EWI Solo is powered off . If it is not, press and hold the Powe r \nButton for a full second. \n2. Use the included USB cable to connect the EWI Solo's USB port to you r\ncomputer. \n \n \nItems not listed under Introduction > Box Contents  in the Quickstart Guide  are sold separately. or \n \n \n5  \n4. Play! \n \nHold the mouthpiece gently between your lips with your teeth, and exhale so your breath passes through both sides \nof your mouth. The EWI Solo detects this wind pressure with the breath sensor and expresses the change in sound \nvolume and character, depending on how you blow. (It should not take much breath to activate the instrument.) \n \nTips: \n\u2022 There is a bite sensor in the mouthpiece. You can produce a vibrato effect by gently biting the mouthpiece, \nwhich will bend the pitch up each time  you bite, but do not bite too hard. \n\u2022 You can articulate the notes you're playing by tonguing the mouthpiece for even more expressive control. \n\u2022 If the EWI Solo's note keys, octave rollers, pitch-bend plate, or glide plates are not very responsive, it could be \nbecause you are playing with dry hands (the EWI Solo works by using the body's capa citance). If this happens, \nyou can use a very small amount of non-greasy hand loti on to improve the connection between your hands and \nthe keys. You can also try adjusting the Sensitivity settings of these features in the Global  Menu. \n \nNote Keys: The note keys are sensors that let you produce sound with only a light \ntouch. The EWI Solo has multiple fingeri ng options, so it can feel familiar to \nsaxophonists, flutists, etc. You can adjust  the position of the three lowest keys by \nloosening the screws that hold each of th em in place, moving them to match your \npreferred playing style and th en retightening the screws. \nImportant:  Use caution when loosening the screws as they may become separated \nfrom the body of the instrument. \n \nOctave Rollers: Place your left thumb between any two octave rollers (and over the \ngrounding plate) on the EWI Solo's back panel. Slide your thumb up or down across \nthe octave rollers to shift its octave range up or down. While playing, keep your left \nthumb in contact with the octave rollers. The position between the two knurled octave \nrollers indicates the standard pitch. \n \nGlide Plate:  While playing a note, move your thumb across the octave rollers (without \nrolling them) while touching the glide plate on th eir right side to create a \"glide\" effect. \nThis will smoothly and contin uously slide the pitch up or  down\u2014a techni que known as \nportamento . \n Pitch-Bend Plate: Touch your thumb to this plate to move the pitch of the note you \nare playing up or down depending on your settings, which can be adjusted in the \nGlobal Menu  (by default, this is set to pitch down). Before you get accustomed to \nusing this plate, you may produce unexpected  sounds by touching it accidentally. You \ncan adjust the position of the plate by loosening its screw, moving it to your \npreference and then retightening the screw.  \n Pitch-Bend \nPlate Standard \nPitch Glide \nPlate \n \n \n6  \nFeatures \n \n1. Mouthpiece:  Hold the mouthpiece gently in between your \nlips with your teeth and exhale in to it (like a traditional wind \ninstrument). You can produce a vibrato effect by gently biting \nthe mouthpiece while blowing into it, but do not bite too \nhard.  \n 2. Note Keys:  Press these keys in different combinations while \nblowing into the mouthpiece to determine the note. See \nAppendix > Fingering Charts\n for more information. \nYou can adjust the position of the three lowest note keys by \nloosening their screws, moving them to match your preferred \nplaying style and then retightening the screws. \n \n3. Hold Button:  Press this button to enter Hold Mode. By \ndefault, Hold Mode is set to Legato ; the first note of a phrase \nwill sustain while you play subsequent notes. Use the  Global \nMenu to adjust this setting. \nWhile viewing a  Program or Favorites list, press and hold \nthis button to move to the previous program. \n \n4. Interval Button:  Press this button to enter Interval Mode. By \ndefault, this is set to Fixed Interval ; when you play a note, \nthat note and the note at the as signed interval will sound (an \noctave below, by default). Use the  Global Menu  to adjust \nthis setting. \nWhile viewing a  Program or Favorites list, press and hold \nthis button to move to the next program. 1\n2\n3\n411\n1314\n15\n16\n2519\n20\n21\n22\n24231775\n9\n148\n10\n126\n2618\n \n \n7  \n5.

It allows \nyou to perform with the articulation of an acoustic instrument but also with the character of an electronic instrument \nwith a wide variety of sounds and tonal colorings. \nThe EWI Solo is a musical instrument much like other acoustic instruments, so the more you practice, the better \nyou'll play. You may find it challenging at first, but as you find and develop your own playin g style, we think you'll find \nit has unlimited possibilities\u2014the re are no hard and fast rules. \nFor reference, you can see an overview of the entire menu structure of EWI Solo in Appendix > Menu Structure . \n \nPrograms \n \nEWI Solo's internal memory includes 200 built-in programs with a variety of sounds and settings. You can switch \nfrom one Program to another to change your sound and sensor settings instantly. \n \nTo select a program: \n1. Press the Prog button to view the list of programs. \n2. Use the encoder to scroll through the list, and then press it to select the program.  \nAlternatively, hold the Hold or Interval buttons to the previous or next pr ogram, respectively, and immediately \nload it. You can keep holding either button to  step through the patche s once every second.  \n \nYou can also use Direct Mode  to quickly select a specific program: \n1. Press and hold either the Prog button or one of the FAV buttons. Holding the Prog button will select from the \nProgram List, and holding a FAV button will select from the chosen Fa vorites list. \n2. While still holding, touch one of the 14 keys and blow into  the mouthpiece. EWI Solo will load from the first 14 \nprograms in the selected list based on the key you are holding.  \nNote:  If you are holding more than one key, the top-most key w ill be given priority; for example, if you are \nholding the K2 and K3 keys when you bl ow into the mouthpiece, the second pr ogram or favorite in the list will be \nselected. \n For a full list of programs, see Appendix > Program List . \n \n \nSaving Programs & Favorites \n \nWhen you make changes to a Program, the Save LED will light to indicate the change s have not been saved. To save \nchanges to a program, use the Save function to add the program to one of four available Favorites  lists. You can \nalso use this function to organize your fa vorite presets, such as for a setlist. \n \nTo save a program in a Favorites list: \n1. Press the Save button. \n2. A prompt will appear on the display asking wher e you would like to save the program. Turn the encoder to select \nFAV1 , FAV2 , FAV3 or FAV4 , and then press it to confirm. \n3. The current list of 25 programs in the c hosen Favorites list will be shown. Turn the encoder to select the slot \nwhere you would like to save your program, and then press it to confirm.  \n4.

Select No to return to the Favorite list and select another slot or exit. \n5. Once the program is saved in the Favorites list,  it will automatically be selected. Press the FAV1 , FAV2 , FAV3 or \nFAV4 button again to exit the Favorite list. \n \n \n \n10  \nEdit Mode \n \nEWI Solo's Edit Mode allows you to adjust the internal programs to your preference. \n \nTo use Edit Mode: \n1. Press the Edit button to enter Edit Mode. \n2. Use the encoder to scroll through the available edit options: Pitch Tuning,  Filter , LFO 1 and LFO 2 . \n\u2022 Pitch Tuning:  This determines the coarse pitch tuning of the pr ogram, up to an octave lower or higher than \nthe pitch played ( -1200 \u2013 0 \u2013 +1200 cents). \n\u2022 Filter: \no Cutoff:  This determines the center frequency of the filter ( -100 \u2013 0  \u2013 +100% ). \no Resonance: This determines the amount of additional amplification of the cutoff frequency ( 0 \u2013 +22.5 dB ).  \n\u2022 LFO 1: This low-frequency oscillator is a slow-moving sine wave that can be used to modulate the filter,  pitch \nor amplitude.  \no Frequency:  This determines the speed of the LFO ( -100 \u2013 0 \u2013 +100% ). \no Delay:  This determines the amount of time before the LFO is activated ( 10.0 ms  \u2013 9.99 s ). \no Amplitude:  This determines how much the LFO affects volume, creating a tremolo effect ( 0.0 dB  \u2013 +12.0 \ndB). \no Filter:  This determines how much the LFO affects the filter, creating \"wah-wah\" effects ( -100 \u2013 0 \u2013 +100% ). \n\u2022 LFO 2: This d\netermines the amount of modulation ( CC#1 ) applied to the program.  \no Frequency:  This determines the speed of the modulation's low-frequency oscillator ( -100 \u2013 0 \u2013 +100% ). \no Delay:  This determines the amount of time before the LFO is activated ( 10.0 ms  \u2013 9.99 s ). \no Pitch:  This determines the coarse pitch tuning of the LFO ( -1200 \u2013 0 \u2013 +1200). \n3. Push the encoder to view the selected option's parameters. \n4. Turn the encoder  to adjust the parameter, and then press the Edit button to return to the previous page. \n5. Press the Edit button again at any time to exit Edit Mode. \n \n \nIf you like the adjustments you have made and want to save them to the program, press the Save button and then \nuse the encoder to select a Favorite list where the program will be saved. See Programs > Saving Programs & \nFavorites  for more information on saving changes to a Program. \nImportant:  When saving, only th e settings that apply to the program will be  saved. Settings that apply to the EWI \nSolo will affect all Programs  because they affect the sensors and tuning of the EWI Solo hardware itself. \n \n \n \n \n11  \nUsing FX \n \nYou can use the EWI Solo's FX Menu to apply and edit three different effects to its audio output: Reverb , Chorus , \nand Delay . \nImportant:  Your EWI Solo's audio output must be enabled to edit  its effects. If you are using it as a MIDI controller \nonly (its Preset LED  is flashing), enable its audio output by pressing and holding the Power Button  until its Preset \nLED is lit solid. \nTip: When FX are added to a Program, the Save LED will light to indicate ch anges have been made. See Programs \n> Saving Programs & Favorites  for more information on saving changes to a Program.  \n \n \nReverb \n \nReverb is a spatial effect, simulating the nuanced reve rberation of sound in the space of a particular room. \n \nTo add Reverb to the Program: \n1. Press the FX button. \n2. Use the encoder to select Reverb , and then press it to select. \n3. Use the encoder to select the Reverb setting, and then press it to select: Off, Small Room , Large Room , Hall, \nCavern or Custom . \nThe Custom setting has the following parameters:  \n\u2022 Level:  This determines the amount of reverb ( 0\u2013100). \n\u2022 Damping:  This determines the how much the simulated room absorbs high frequencies as the reverberated \nsound decays over time ( 0 [no absorption] \u2013 100 [most absorption]). \n\u2022 Room:  This determines the size of the room simulated ( 0 [smallest] \u2013 100 [largest]). \nUse the encoder to select the parameter, and then press it to move to the next page. Turn the encoder to \nchange the parameter value, and then press the FX button to move back to the previous page. \n4. To exit the FX menu, press the FX button again. \n \nChorus \n \nThe Chorus effect modulates the pitch and a delay of the input signal, which are then added to the dry signal. In \nsmall amounts, this create s the illusion of multiple vo ices playing at once.  \n \nTo add Chorus to the Program: \n1. Press the FX button. \n2. Use the encoder to select Chorus , and then press it to select. \n3. Use the encoder to select the Chorus setting, and then press it to select: Off, Light , Medium , Heavy  or \nCustom . \nThe Custom setting has the following parameters:  \n\u2022 Level:  This determines the amount of chorus applied ( 0\u2013100). \n\u2022 Rate:  This determines the rate of mo dulation for the chorus effect ( 1\u20133 Hz ). \n\u2022 Depth:  This determines the depth or intensity of modulation for the chorus effect ( 0 [subtle] \u2013 100 [heavy]). \nUse the encoder  t o  s e l e c t  t h e  p a r a m e t e r ,  a n d  t h e n  p r e s s  i t  t o  m o v e  t o  t h e  n e x t  p a g e .  T u r n  t h e  encoder to \nchange the parameter value, and then press the FX button to move back to the previous page. \n4. To exit the FX menu, press the FX button again. \n \n \n12  \nDelay \n \nThe Delay effect produces an echo of the orig inal signal for a specified period of time. \n \nTo add Delay to the Program: \n1. Press the FX button. \n2. Use the encoder to select Delay , and then press it to select. \n3. Use the encoder to select the Delay setting, and then press it to select: Off, Short , Mirror , Long or Custom . \nThe Custom setting has the following parameters:  \n\u2022 Level:  This determines the amount of delay applied ( 0\u2013100). \n\u2022 Time:  This determines the rate of the delay ( 0.0\u2013742.9 ms ). \n\u2022 Feedback:  This determines the amou nt of delay signal routed back into the effect ( 0\u2013100) \nUse the encoder  t o  s e l e c t  t h e  p a r a m e t e r ,  a n d  t h e n  p r e s s  i t  t o  m o v e  t o  t h e  n e x t  p a g e .  T u r n  t h e  encoder  to \nchange the parameter value, and then press the FX button to move back to the previous page. \n4. To exit the FX menu, press the FX button again. \n \n \n \n \n13  \nGlobal Menu \n \nThe EWI Solo has been given optimal default settings, but we recommend adjusting them to your preference to get \nthe most out of your performance. You can customize these settings in Global Mode.  \nTo enter the Global Menu,  press the Global button. \nTo navigate the Global Menu, turn the encoder .  \nTo select a submenu or option, press the encoder . \nTo move backwards in the Global Menu or exit it,  press the Global button. \n Though adjusting the settings may seem complicated, you won' t need to it every time you perform. The values you \nset are essential to the EWI Solo's fu nctionality, and your perf ormance will be much more  expressive and precise \nwhen the settings match your playing style. Once you adjust everything to your preference, you won't need to adjust anything much further. \nYou can adjust the following sensors. Click one of them to skip to that part of the chapter. \n \nBreath Senso\nr Hold Button\nBite Senso r Interval Button\nKey Action LFO/Modulation\nFine Tuning MIDI Channe l\nFingering Speake r\nGlide Plate 30min Idle Shutdown\nPitch Bend Plate Patch Font Size\n \n \n \n14  \nBreath Sensor  \nThe mouthpiece's breath sensor translat es the strength of your breath into the volume and character of the note \nyou're playing. It's important to set the sensor 's sensitivity so it su its your playing style. \nTip: If this is your first time using the EWI Solo, you may want use a \"lighter\" breath sensor setting for easier blowing. \nWith practice, you can set this control at a \"heavier\" setting for a more expressive performance. \n\u2022 Offset:  This determines the minimum amount of breath required before playing a note  (0\u2013100). \n\u2022 Sensitivity:  This determines how responsive the breath sensor is to the amount of breath you use ( 0\u2013100). \n\u2022 Learn Mode:  While blowing into the unit, press the Hold or Interval buttons  to latch minimum or maximum level, \nrespectively. The current Offset  and Sensitivity values are shown at the bottom of the screen. \n\u2022 Capture Delay:  This determines how much delay there is between the moment you blow into the mouthpiece \nand the Note On me ssage is sent ( 1\u201310). \n\u2022 Output Mode : This determines what type of MI DI data the Breath Sensor sends. \no Breath CC: In this mode, the Breath Sensor sends either a single breath message using CC#2 , or a high-\nresolution breath message using both CC#2  and CC#34 . \nSelect Low to send messages using only CC#2, or select Hi to send messages using both CC#2  and CC#34  \n(an additional message will be sent using CC#88 before each Note On Message, except when the velocity is \nlocked). \no Volume CC: In this mode, the Breath Sensor sends either a single volume message using CC#7  or a high-\nresolution volume message using both CC#7  and CC#39 . \nSelect Low to send messages using only CC#7, or select Hi to send messages using both CC#7  and CC#39  \n(an additional message will be sent using CC#88 before each Note On Message, except when the velocity is \nlocked). \no Expre\nssion CC: In this mode, the Breath Sensor sends either a single expression message using CC#11  or \na high-resolution expression message using both CC#11  and CC#43. \nSelect Low to send messages using only CC#11 , or select Hi to send messages using both CC#11 and \nCC#43 (an additional message will be sent using CC#88  before each Note On Message, except when the \nvelocity is locked). \no Aftertouch: In this mode, the Breath Sensor sends Aftertouch (polyphonic pressure) messages.  \no Channel Pressure: In this mode, the Breath Sensor sends Channel Pressure messages.  \no Custom CC:  In this mode, the Breath Sensor sends a custom MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message. \n\uf0a7 Controller Number:  This determines the custom controller number for the Breath Sensor ( 0\u2013127). \nImportant:  We recommend not touching the mouthpiece while changing this parameter to prevent \naccidentally muting the EWI Solo's  output while moving through CC#7  (Volume). \n\uf0a7 No Breath:  This determines the value that is sent by the controller number when you are not blowing \ninto the mouthpiece (0 \u2013127). \n\uf0a7 Breath:  This determines the value that is sent by the controller number when you are blowing into the \nmouthpiece ( 0\u2013127). \n\u2022 Lock Velocity:  When this is on, the breath sensor  will not affect velocity; all Note  On messages will be sent with \na fixed velocity. \no Enable:  This determines whether Lock Ve locity is enabled or disabled ( Off, On). \no Output Velocity: This determines the fixed velocity value sent by Note On messages ( 0\u2013127). \n\u2022 Constant Output:  When this is on, the breath sensor  sends breath messages with a fixed value and continually \noutputs sound. This can be useful when working with exte rnal effects or using the EWI Solo as a sound source. \no Enable:  This determines whether Constant Output is enabled or disabled ( Off, On). \no Output Velocity: This determines the fixed va lue for breath messages ( 0\u2013127). \n \n \n \n15  \nBite Sensor \nThe bite sensor controls the character of the vibrato effect you generate when you bite the mouthpiece while playing \na note. \nNote:  The vibrato effect is obtained by biting the mouthp iece many times rather than a single steady bite. \n\u2022 Sensitivity:  This determines how responsive the bite se nsor is to the amount of pressure used ( 0\u201325). The higher \nthe value, the less pressure required when biting the mouthpiece. \n\u2022 Filter:  A high-pass filter will be applied to the bite sensor ( Off, On). When this is on, any note that sounds as you \nbite the mouthpiece will eventually return to its original state, even if  you bite continuously. \n\u2022 Output Mode: This determines what type of MIDI data the Bite Sensor sends.  \no Off: In this mode, the Bite Sensor is disabled.  \no Pitch Bend:  In this mode, biting the mouthpiece will be nd the pitch of the note being played ( -63 \u2013 0 \u2013 +63). \no Add to Breath:  In this mode, biting the mouthpiece will change the Breath Sensor 's output ( -63 \u2013 0 \u2013 +63). \no Custom CC: In this mode, biting the mouthpiece sends a cu stom MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message.  \n\uf0a7 Controller Number:  This determines the controller number that  is sent when you bite the mouthpiece \n(0\u2013127). \nImportant:  We recommend not touching the mouthpiece while changing this parameter to prevent \naccidentally muting the EWI Solo's  output while moving through CC#7  (Volume). \n\uf0a7 Not Biting:  This determines the value that is sent by the Controller Number when you are not biting the \nmouthpiece ( 0\u2013127). \n\uf0a7 Biting:  This determines the value that is sent by the Controller Number when you are biting the \nmouthpiece ( 0\u2013127). \n \n \nKey Action \nThe EWI Solo's note key action is preset to  accommodate rapid changes in fi ngerings, but you may occasionally \nproduce unexpected sounds, depending on your playing style.  In this case, you may find that you can play more \nsmoothly by adjusting the Key Delay. \n\u2022 Key Delay:  This determines how long a key must be  held before registering a key press ( 1\u201320). \nTip: You can play notes more smoothly with a larger Note Delay value, but it may prevent you from playing \nquickly. We recommend setting as  small a value as possible.  \n\u2022 Key Sensitivity:  This determines how responsive the keys are to touch ( 1\u201313). The higher the value, the lighter \ntouch required to trigger the note key. \n\u2022 Enable K10:  This determines whether the K10 key is enabled ( On, Off). By default, the key is enabled. When \ndisabled, the K10 key w ill have no effect on notes bu t can still be touched to perform other key actions such as \nDirect Mode. \n \n \nFine Tuning \nThis determines the fine tuning of the EWI Solo ( -100 \u2013 0 \u2013 +100  cents). For coarse pitch tuning, use the Pitch \nTuning setting in the Edit Menu . \n \n \n \n \n \n16  \nFingering \nThe EWI Solo lets you select from different fingering modes to accommoda te different styles of playing. \n\u2022 Standard EWI:  This mode is the standard fingering for the EWI Solo, based on the fingering of conventional \nwoodwind instruments. \n\u2022 Saxophone:  This mode closely represents the fingerings of a standard saxophone. In this mode, EWI Solo \nwill ignore fingers that are tw o notes below the highest note. \n\u2022 Flute:  This mode closely represents the finge rings of a standard C flute, though  flutists will have to familiarize \nthemselves with a few new fingerings to properly adapt their performance to the EWI Solo. \n\u2022 Oboe:  This mode resembles that of a standard oboe, thoug h oboists will have to familiarize themselves with \na few new fingerings to properly adapt their performance to the EWI Solo. \n\u2022 EVI: EVI stands for electronic valve instrument .  T h i s  m o d e  m a y  b e  u s e f u l  t o  p l a y e r s  w h o  w i s h  t o  u s e  \nfingerings closer to those of a brass instrument.  \n\u2022 Reverse EVI: This mode most closely resembles the movement of the left wrist on an actual EVI \n(recommended mostly for experienced EVI players). \n \nPlease refer to Appendix > Fingering Charts  to see the differences between the various fingering modes. \n \n \nGlide Plate \nThe EWI Solo's glide plate lets you use a glide effect called portamento  to move between notes for greater \nexpressiveness in your performance. Alternatively, you can set the glide plate to send messages for other individual \nMIDI Continuous Controllers (CCs). \nImportant:  \nMake sure Portamento  is selected as the Glide Plate mode if you wa nt to use the portamento effect. The EWI Solo's \nsynth needs this setting to be enabled in order for portamento to work properly. \nSome sound modules may not handle portamento messages well, which could generate some undesirable sounds. If \nthis is the case, make sure Portamento  is not selected as the Glide Plate mode. \n\u2022 Portamento:  In this mode, the glide plate sends messages using CC#5  for Portamento. \no Time CC Enable: This determines whether CC#5  output is enabled ( On) or disabled ( Off). \no Time CC Data-Up: This determines the CC number that is sent when you are not touching the plate ( 0\u2013127). \no Time CC Data-Press:  This determines the value that is sent wi th the CC number when you are touching the \nglide plate ( 0\u2013127). \no Switch Enable  When enabled, the glide plat e will send its messages using CC#65 ( Off, On). \n\u2022 Legato Time:  In this mode, the glide plate sends legato time messages using CC#104. This is the time between \nwhen a note ends as a new note begins. Short times will result in mo re abrupt changes be tween notes, while \nlonger times will result in more flui d changes that sound almost slurred. \no Data-Up:  This determines the CC number that will be  sent when you are no t touching the plate ( 0\u2013127). \no Data-Press:  This determines th e value that will be sent with the CC number when you are touching the plate \n(0\u2013127). \n\u2022 Custom CC: In this mode, the Glide Plate sends a custom  MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message. \no Controller Number:  This determines the controller number for the Glide plate ( 0\u2013127). \nImportant:  We recommend not touching the Glide Plate while changing this parameter to prevent \naccidentally muting the EWI Solo's output while moving through CC#7  (Volume). \no Data-Up:  This determines the CC number that will be  sent when you are no t touching the plate ( 0\u2013127). \no Data-Press:  This determines th e value that will be sent with the CC number when you are touching the plate \n(0\u2013127). \n \n \n \n17  \nPitch Bend Plate \nWhen you touch the pitch-bend plate, the EWI Solo will bend the pitch of th e note you are playing, allowing you to be \nmore expressive with your performance. Alternatively, y ou can set the pitch-bend plate to send messages for other \nindividual MIDI Continuous Controllers (CCs). \nImportant:  The overall change in pitch varies by how much of  the plate your thumb is touching as well how it is \ntouching the plate. Experiment with these settings for the best results.  \n\u2022 Pitch Bend:  In this mode, touching the Pitch Bend Plate bends the pitch of the note being played ( -63 \u2013 0 \u2013 +63). \n\u2022 Custom CC: In this mode, the Pitch Bend Plate sends a custom MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message.  \no Controller Number:  This determines the controller number se nt when you touch the Pitch Bend plate ( 0\u2013\n127). \nImportant:  We recommend not touching the Pitch Bend Plate while changing this parameter to prevent \naccidentally muting the EWI Solo's output while moving through CC#7  (Volume). \no Data-Up: This determines the CC number that is sent when you are not touching the plate ( 0\u2013127). \no Data-Press:  This determines the value that is sent with the CC number when you are touching the plate ( 0\u2013\n127). \n \n \nHold Button \nWhen you press the Hold button, the EWI Solo will enter Hold Mode, which allows you to play and hold a note and \nthen play another note or melody line over that held note. \n\u2022 Off: Select this to disa ble the Hold button. \n\u2022 Legato Mode:  In this mode, pressing the Hold button before playing a note w ill activate Hold Mode. The first \nnote you play (or are currently playing) after pressing the Hold button will be held out even as you continue play \ndifferent notes after that using the same breath. Starting a new phrase (i.e., taking a breath and blowing into the mouthpiece again) will resu lt in a new held note. \nWhen set to No Latch, the Hold button acts as a momentary switch and must be held to activate Hold mode. \nWhen set to latch , the Hold button acts as a toggle switch and must be pressed again to deactivate. \n\u2022 Non-legato Mode:  In this mode, the Hold button can only be pressed while a note is currently being held. This \nnote will then continue to be held ou t even as you continue to play different notes and phrases. To change the \nheld note, press (or release) the Hold button to deactivate hold mode, and then press the Hold button again \nwhen you are playing the new note. \nWhen set to No Latch, the Hold button acts as a momentary switch and must be held to activate Hold mode. \nWhen set to latch , the Hold button acts as a toggle switch and must be pressed again to deactivate. \nNote:  Certain programs will not work with  Non-legato Mode as intended. See Appendix > Program List  for \nmore information. \n\u2022 Custom CC: In this mode, the Hold button sends a custom MIDI Contin uous Controller (CC) message. \no Controller Number: This determines the controller number for the Hold button ( 0\u2013127). \no Data:  This determines the value that will be sent when the Hold button is pressed while playing ( 0\u2013127). A \nvalue of 0 is sent when released. The Latch Mode  setting determines the method of release. \no Latch Mode: When set to No Latch , the Hold button acts as a momentary switch and must be held to \nactivate Hold mode. When set to latch , the Hold button acts as a toggle switch  and must be pressed again \nto deactivate. \n \n \n \n18  \nInterval Button \nWhen you press the Interval Button, the EWI Solo will enter Interval Mode, which will cause an additional note\u2014at a \nparticular interval\u2014to sound above or below the fingered note, creating a harmonized sound. \nImportant:  While in Interval Mode, po rtamento messages from the glide plate will be disabled. \n\u2022 Off: Select this to disable the Interval button. \n\u2022 Fixed Interval:  In this mode, pressing the Interval button will play a harmony at the interval set here ( -24 \u2013 0  \u2013 +24). \n\u2022 Real-time Interval:  In this mode, the interval is set dynamically while playing:  \ni. Play a note and hold it. \nii. While the note is playing, press the Interval button. \niii. Play another note. The interv al between the two no tes will be interval of the harm onized voice. Deactivate the \ninterval by pressing the Interval button again. \n\u2022 Custom CC: In this mode, the Interval button sends a custom MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message.  \no Controller Number:  Sets the controller number for the Interval button ( 0\u2013100). \no Data:  The value that will be sent  when the Interval button is pressed while playing ( 0\u2013127). A value of 0 is \nsent when released. The Latch Mode  setting determines the method of release. \no Latch Mode:  When set to No Latch , the Interval button acts as a momentary switch and must be held to \nactivate Interval mode. When set to latch , the Interval button acts as a toggle switch and must be pressed \nagain to deactivate. \n \n \nLFO/Modulation \nThis determines a minimum amount of modulation ( CC#1 ) to be applied. Any additional controls that output to CC#1 \nare scaled between this minimum amount and 127. \n \n \nMIDI Channel \nThe EWI Solo will send MIDI messages  over an assigned MIDI channel ( 1\u201316). This channel is also the synth's input \nchannel. \n \n \nSpeaker \nThis determines the behavior  of the built-in speaker: \n\u2022 Off: The built-in speaker is always off. \n\u2022 Off by HP/Line : The built-in speaker is only off when the headphone or Line Out ports are in use. \n\u2022 On: The built-in speaker is always on. \n \n \n30min Idle Shutdown \nThis determines whether the power saving function of EWI Solo is disabled ( Off) or enabled ( On). When enabled, EWI \nSolo will automatically power down to save battery afte r 30 minutes of inactivity. \n \n \nPatch Font Size \nThis determines the size of the text on the display when viewing the Program list or Favorites ( Small , Large). By \ndefault, this is set to Large. \n  \n \n \n19  \nOther Functions \n \nRestoring Default Settings \n \nTo return all of the EWI Solo's settings to its factory defaults: \n1.

It allows you to perform with the articulation of an acoustic instrument but also with the character of \nan electronic instrument with a wide variety of sounds and tonal colorings .  The EWI4000s has an internal \nsound module and effects, so you can enjoy playing it si mply by connecting the EWI 4000s to an amplifier or \nheadphones.  To get the most out of your EWI4000s, study th is manual to learn about its features and \nfunctions. \n \nThe EWI4000s has two modes : Play Mode and Adjust Mode.  When you turn the EWI4000s on, it will be in \nPlay Mode.  If you wish to adjust t he sensors\u2019 sensitivity or MIDI settings, you can change to the Adjust Mode \nby pressing the SETUP BUTTON.  Please take some time to read this Basic Operation section before playing the EWI4000s. \n \n BASIC OPERATION \n This section explains the basic oper ation of the EWI4000s and how to \nadjust its settings.   \n \n HOW TO HOLD THE EWI4000s \n Hold the EWI4000s the same way as you would hold a saxophone or clarinet.  The EWI4000s\u2019s NOTE KEYS are sensors that respond to your \ntouch.  They are useful for playing fast passages, but t hey are different \nfrom the key action of an ordinary wind instrument.  Be sure to use a neck \nstrap so you can move your fingers freely.  \n \n      \n OPERATING THE NOTE KEYS, OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS, & GROUNDING PLATES \n \n\u0084  Note Keys    \nThe NOTE KEYS allow you to produce sound with just a light touch.  \nThe EWI4000s has several different fingerings available, including saxophone, flute, and oboe.  Please refer to the FINGERING CHARTS \nsection for details.  You can also change the EWI4000s\u2019s fingering \nconfiguration, designing your own uni que fingerings that could not exist \non an acoustic sound instrument.   \n\u0084  Octave Shift Rollers  \n \nPlace your left thumb on the back side of the EWI4000s, between any \ntwo OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS.  While playing, keep your left thumb \ntouching the rollers.  The position bet ween the two knurled rollers will \ngive you standard pitch.    \n\u0084  Grounding Plates   \n \nThere are two GROUNDING PLATES for your right and left hands.  \nAlways keep either of your thumbs on its GROUNDING PLATE while \nplaying.  \n\n \n12  \n USING THE MOUTHPIECE \n \n\u0084  Mouthpiece    \nHold the mouthpiece gently in your m outh with your teeth, and exhale so \nthe breath is passed through both end s of your mouth.  The EWI4000s \ndetects this wind pressure with t he breath sensor and expresses the \nchange in sound volume and character.   The EWI4000s unique breathing \nstructure is designed so that very lit tle breath is required to pass through \nthe instrument.  You can use various breathing techniques to sustain or \nshape notes for powerfully expressive performances.   \n  \n\u0084  Vibrato    \n \nThere is a vibrato sensor in the MOUTHPIECE.  Y ou can produce a vibrato effect by gently biting the \nMOUTHPIECE.  Do not bite too hard as this may dam age the vibrato sensor or the MOUTHPIECE itself. \n  \n\u0084  Tonguing   \n \nYou can create small bursts of air by tonguing the mouthpiece for even more expressive control. \n \nNote:  Adjust the S (Sense) SENSOR ADJUSTMENT KNOB to create different tonguing nuances. \n \n \n USING THE PITCH BEND PLATES, GLIDE PLATES, & HOLD & OCTAVE BUTTONS \n \n\u0084  Pitch Bend Plates    \nBy touching the PITCH BEND UP PLATE or  PITCH BEND DOWN PLATE with your \nthumb (while also touching a GROUNDING PLATE) , you can raise or lower the pitch \nof the note being played.  Adjust the pitch bend range with the W (Width) SENSOR \nADJUSTMENT KNOB.  \nNote:  Before you get accustomed to us ing these plates, you may produce \nunexpected sounds by touching them accident ally.  You can adjust the position of \neach plate by loosening its screw. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u0084  Glide Plate    \nBy moving your thumb acro ss the OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS \nwhile touching the GLIDE PLATE,  you can achieve a \u201cglide\u201d \neffect, which will smoothly and continuously slide the pitch \nbeing played up or down.  This is known as portamento .  \nAdjust the glide time using the T (Time) knob on the GL \n(Glide) section of the EWI4000s. \n \nNote:  Before you get used to cont rolling this plate, you may \nproduce unexpected sounds by t ouching them accidentally. \n\n \n13  \n\u0084  Hold Button and Octave Button  \nPressing the HOLD BUTTON will engage or disengage the \nEWI4000s\u2019s Hold Mode (see the HOLD  MODE section) or serve as \na Program Up button while in Play Mode.  While in Adjust Mode, the \nHOLD BUTTON serves as a \u201c+\u201d (Increase) button.   \n Pressing the OCTAVE BUTTON will let you engage or disengage \nthe Octave function (see the OCT AVE FUNCTION section) or serve \nas a Program Down button while in Play Mode.  While in Adjust Mode, the OCTAVE BUTTON serves as a \u201c\u2013\u201d (Decrease) button. \n     \n ADJUSTING THE SENSITIVITY OF THE SENSORS \n To fully use the EWI4000s\u2019s variou s performance features, you should \nproperly adjust the breath, glide, ben d, and vibrato sensors to your own \nperforming requirements.  Each sensor  has been set properly in the factory, \nbut we recommend adjusting them on your own before playing the \nEWI4000s.  The SENSOR  ADJUSTMENT KNOBS are located under the \ncover above the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY.  Remove the cover as shown in the drawing.    The function of each knob is shown below: \n \nGL: Glide  \nA: Glide Sensor Adjustment \nT: Glide Time Setting \n \nPB: Pitch Bend \n A: Pitch Bend Sensor Adjustment  \n W: Pitch Bend Width \n \nVB: Vibrato \n A: Vibrato Depth Adjustment \n \nBR: Breath \n A: Breath Sensor Adjustment  S: Breath Sensitivity \n      \nTo adjust a sensor\u2019s sens itivity, press the SETUP BUTTON to enter Adjust Mode.  The PROGRAM / DATA \nDISPLAY will indicate the sensor being adjusted. \n \nGlide \n   Breath Bend DownBend Up\n \n14  \n\u0084  Adjusting the Breath Sensor   \nThe breath sensor translates the strength of your breath into \nthe volume and character of the note you\u2019re playing.  It\u2019s \nimportant to set the sensor\u2019s sens itivity so it suits your style \nof playing.   1. Set the \u201cS\u201d (Sensitivity) knob in the \u201cBR\u201d (Breath) \nsection to the center position, and then turn the \u201cA\u201d \n(Adjust) knob clockwise.  T he \u201cBreath\u201d indicator should \nlight up on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY.  If you turn the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) knob counterclockwise, it should \ngo off. \nNote:  If the \u201cBreath\u201d indicato r is lit, the EWI4000s will \nproduce sound.  Be careful of the volume settings on \nany connected equipment while adjusting the breath \nsensor. \n2. Turn the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) k nob slowly counterclockwise \nfrom the position where the indicator is lighting up, and set it to the position where the indicator goes off. \n3. Blow into the MOUTHPIECE.  The breath sensor is properly  adjusted if the sound starts when you blow \n(and stops when you stop blowing). \n4. To adjust the \u201cS\u201d (Sense) knob for breath sensitivity, blow into t he MOUTHPIECE with various breath \nstrengths to confirm t hat the output sound volume changes depending on your breath strength.  To \nchange this setting, turn the \u201cS\u201d (Sense) knob.  For greater sensitivity, turn the knob clockwise.  For \nless, turn it counterclockwise.  At  a higher sensitivity, you may have less available articulation but not \nneed to blow as hard.  At a lower sensitivity, you will need to blow harder to produce a sound, but you \ncan be more expressive with it.  \n \nNote:  After adjusting the S (Sense) knob, you need to adjust the A (Adjust) knob again. \n  \n\u0084  Adjusting the Pitch Bend Sensors \n \nThis section explains how to adjust the sensors for the Pitch \nBend Up and Down functions and sets the width of these bends.  \n \n1. Set the \u201cW\u201d (Width) knob in the \u201cPB\u201d (Pitch Bend) \nsection to the right-most (f ully clockwise) position. \n2. While touching your thumb only to the GROUNDING \nPLATE (without touching the PITCH BEND UP PLATE or PITCH BEND DOWN PLATE), adjust the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) knob in the \u201cPB\u201d (Pitch Bend) section so that both the UP and DOWN indicators on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY turn off. \n3. Play the EWI4000s and use the PITCH BEND UP \nPLATE and PITCH BEND DOWN PLATE.  The bend sensor is properly adjusted if a note\u2019s pitch raises \nor lowers (and the upper or lower indicator LED li ghts up) appropriately when you touch either of the \nbend plates.  If you still want to adju st the settings, experiment more with the \u201cW\u201d (Width) knob.  The \nrange becomes narrower as you turn it counterclo ckwise (and wider as you turn it clockwise). \n The overall change in pitch va ries by how much of the plate your thum b is touching as well how it is touching \nthe plate.  You\u2019ll need to experiment with the bend pl ates and sensor adjustment fo r the best results.   \n \nNote:  After adjusting the W (Width) knob, you will  need to adjust the A (Adjust) knob again. \n\n \n15  \n\u0084  Adjusting the Vibrato Sensor   \nBy gently biting on the MO UTHPIECE, you can produce a \nvibrato effect.  This section explains how to adjust the vibrato sensor.  1. Set the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) knob in the \u201cVB\u201d (Vibrato) section to \nthe center position.  \n2. While playing a long tone on the EWI4000s, bite the \nMOUTHPIECE lightly.  The s ensor is properly adjusted \nif you get the vibrato effect while biting the MOUTHPIECE.  \n3. If you feel the vibrato is not set for your particular \nplaying style, turn the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) knob clockwise and try it again.    \nNote:  The vibrato effect is obtained by biting the Mout hpiece many times rather than a single steady bite. \n \n \n\u0084  Adjusting the Glide Sensor  \n \nThis section explains how to  adjust the glide sensor. \n 1. Set the \u201cT\u201d (Time) knob in t he \u201cGL\u201d (Glide) section to \nthe center position.  If you turn the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) knob \nclockwise, the Glide indicato r should light up.  If you \nturn the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) k nob counterclockwise, the \nindicator should go off. \n2. When the Glide indicator\u2019s LED is lit, turn the \u201cA\u201d \n(Adjust) knob slightly counterclockwise until the \nindicator LED goes off. \n3. Play the EWI4000s and move your thumb across the \nGlide plate (while t ouching the OCTAVE SHIFT \nROLLERS).  You should hear the glide (or portamento ) \neffect when you change from one note to another. \n4. To confirm the proper gli de sensor setting, change the \noctave with the OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS while playing.  The pitch of the sound shou ld slide slowly, not quickly.  If you wish to make the slide time \nlonger, turn the \u201cT\u201d (Time) knob clockw ise.  To shorten the slide time, tu rn it counterclockwise.  You can \nset the \u201cTime\u201d or \u201cRate\u201d of the glide\u2019s pitch sh ift.  (See SETTING THE GLIDE EFFECT TIME & RATE \nfor more information.) \n \nNote:  After adjusting the \u201cT\u201d (Time)  knob, you will need to adjust the \u201cA\u201d (Adjust) knob again. \n\n \n16  \n\u0084  Adjusting the Touch Sensors   \nThe EWI4000s uses Touch S ensor keys, not mechanical \nswitches.  Typically, there is  no need to adjust the Touch \nSensor sensitivity bec ause it is adjusted at  the factory.  If \nthere are significant changes in temperature or humidity (or static electricity) , though, the sensors may not respond \ncorrectly (e.g. the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY may show \nother numbers while in Play  Mode instead of showing the \ncorrect Program number).  In  these cases, you may need to \nadjust the touch sens or sensitivity. \n 1. While in Play Mode, touch the NOTE KEYS K1, K2, \nand K3 (see the FINGERING CHART for details), the \nGROUNDING PLATE, and the OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS.  Do not touch the PROGRAM KEY . \n \n2. If there are numbers s hown on the PROGRAM / \nDATA DISPLAY, turn the TOUCH SENSOR SENSITIVITY ADJUSTMENT KNOB  clockwise until \nthe numbers disappear.  If there are no numbers on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY, turn the knob counterclockwise until numbers are shown, then turn it \nclockwise until the they disappear, and then turn it \nslightly clockwise again.  Be sure that no number is \nshown on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY if you touch several NOTE KEYS simultaneously. \n    \n \n \n\u0084  A Note About Adjusting Your Sensors \n \nThough adjusting the sensors is  seemingly complicated, \nproper key sensitivity is e ssential to the EWI4000s\u2019s \nfunctionality.  Plus, you can play with much more expression and precision if you adjust the s ensors to match your style.  \nOnce you adjust the sensors to your liking, you won\u2019t need to \nadjust them every time you pl ay unless its sensitivity is \nchanged by circumstances such as temperature. In this \ncase, simply adjust the sensors again.        \nIf you are just beginning with  the EWI4000s, you may want \nto set the breath sensor lightly (by turning the \u201cS\u201d (Sense) \nknob in the clockwise direction)  for easier blowing.  With \npractice, you can set this control at a \u201cheavier\u201d setting for a \nmore expressive performance.   The EWI4000s is a musical \ninstrument much like other acous tic instruments, so the more \nyou practice, the better you will play.  At first, you may find \nplaying the EWI4000s challengi ng, but we believe you will \nfind it to be a fantastic instrume nt with unlimited possibilities. \nThere are no hard and fast rules for playing it, and we encourage you to find your own playing style. \n\n \n17 \n \n FINGERING MODES \n \nThe EWI4000s offers several different fingering modes to accommodate different styles of playing.  The \nfollowing steps explain how to set or change the fing ering mode of the EWI4000s  to suit your needs. \n \n1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.   \n2. Press the HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON to scroll through the options until \u201c Fn\u201d \n(Fingering) is shown in th e PROGRAM DATA / DISPLAY.  \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  The PROGRAM / DATA  DISPLAY will display the current mode.  Use \nthe HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON to  select any of the following options: \n    \n     \n     \n     \n     \n  \n \na. \u201cEI\u201d (standard EWI fingering):  This is the standar d fingering system for the EWI4000s.  This is \nbased on the fingering of conven tional woodwind instruments. \nb. \u201cSA\u201d (Saxophone fingering):  This fingering closely represents the fingerings of a standard \nsaxophone.  (In this mode, the EWI will ignore fi ngers that are two notes below the highest note.) \nc. \u201cFL\u201d (Flute fingering):  This fingering closely represents the fingerings of a standard C flute.  \nThere are, however, a couple new fi ngerings that flutists  will have to familiarize themselves with \nto properly adapt their per formance to the EWI4000s. \nd. \u201cOb\u201d (Oboe fingering):  This fingering closely repr esents the fingerings of a standard oboe.   \ne. \u201cEv\u201d (EVI fingering):  \u201cEVI\u201d stands for \u201celectric valve instrument.\u201d  This fingering may be useful to \nplayers who wish to use fingerings clos er to those of a brass instrument. \nf. \u201cEr\u201d (EVI fingering with reversed OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS):  This fingering most closely \nduplicates the movement of t he left wrist on an actual EVI.  We recommend this mode for \nexperienced EVI players. \n4. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI4000s will return to Play Mode. \n \nPlease refer to the FINGERING CHARTS section to see the differences between the various fingering \nmodes. \n \n18  \n CHAPTER 3: INTERNAL SOUND \n \n PROGRAM KEY FUNCTIONS \n \n\u0084  Selecting the Internal  Sounds (Program Key)  \nThe EWI4000s has 100 internal pres et sounds called Programs.  You \ncan switch between Programs by  selecting Program numbers.  \n 1. Without touching any NOTE KEYS, press and hold the \nPROGRAM KEY. The current Progr am number is displayed on \nthe PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY as you are touching the PROGRAM KEY.  (If you rel ease the PROGRAM KEY, the \nPROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY will return to its previous state.) \nNote:  If you touch any NOTE KEYS , the PROGRAM / DATA \nDISPLAY will show the Program number assigned to that \nspecific NOTE KEY , not the currently selected Program number. \n2. While holding in the PROGRAM KEY, you can select a new \nProgram number by pressing the HOLD BUTTON, which works as \u201c+\u201d (increase) button, or the OCTAVE BUTTON, which works \nas \u201c\u2013\u201d (decrease) button. \n3. The sound will change to match the currently displayed Program \nnumber after you release the PROGRAM KEY. \n  \n \n    \n\u0084  Assigning a Program Number to a Note Key \n \nYou can change the Program number di rectly by touching the NOTE KEYS after assigning a Program \nnumber to the NOTE KEYS.  Instead of increasing/ decreasing the Program numbers with the HOLD \nBUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON, this feature allows you to access other Programs quickly during live \nperformances.   \n 1. Select the Program number you wish to assign to the NOTE KEY as described in \u201cSelecting the \nInternal Sounds (Program)\u201d section above. \n2. While holding in the PROGRAM KEY, press the SETUP  BUTTON.  The selected Program number will \nblink on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY. \n3. Touch the NOTE KEY you wish to assign to the selected program. \n4. Blow into the MOUTHPIECE.  The selected Pr ogram will be assigned to the NOTE KEY you are \ntouching. \n This feature can be used a few different ways, which are explained in the SETTING PROGRAM CHANGE \nPREFERENCES section below. \n\n \n19  \n\u0084  Setting Program Change Preferences   \nThis section explains how to set th e EWI4000s to access your program \nchanges in various ways.  1.

Use \nthe HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON to  select any of the following options: \n \n    \n     \n  \na. \u201cdP\u201d (Direct Program Change):  This setting will let you assign program changes to the notes of \nonly one octave.  That is, you can have a total of  12 program changes available to you on the 12 \nNOTE KEYS, regardless of the octave in which you are playing. \nb. \u201cAL\u201d (All):  This setting will let you assign program changes to every note playable.  That is, you \ncan have a total of 96 program changes available to you on the 12 NOTE KEYS, with each NOTE \nKEY having a different program change assignment  in each octave (8 total octaves). \nc. \u201cEt\u201d (MIDI Program Change):  This  setting will enable the sendi ng of MIDI Program Change \nmessages.  (See \u201cProgram Change\u201d under th e ABOUT MIDI section in Chapter 4.) \n4. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI 4000s will return to Play Mode. \n \n \n\u0084  Recalling the Program Numb er Assigned to a Note Key  \nThis explains how to recall a Program number that is assigned to a NOTE KEY. \n 1. While touching the PROGRAM KEY, t ouch the NOTE KEY you wish to recall.  The PROGRAM / DATA \nDISPLAY will show the Program number currently assigned to that NOTE KEY. \n2. Blow into the MOUTHPIECE.  The Program number will be changed. \n \nNote:  While touching the PROGRAM KEY , no sound will when blowing into the Mouthpiece. \n\n \n20  \n ALTERNATE WAY OF SELECTING THE PROGRAM NUMBER \n \nSelecting Programs is usually done by touching the PROGRAM KEY, but the EWI4000s also allows you to change \nPrograms by pressing the HOLD \nBUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON with the following settings.  It may be convenient when you need to change the Program number while playing a song.  While doing this, the HOLD BUTTON and OCTAVE BUTTON will increase or \ndecrease the Program number, instead \nof the entering Hold Mode or Octave Mode.   \n\u0084  Program Up with the Hold Button  \n \nNote:  While going through these steps, you cannot enter Hold Mode. \n 1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON. \n2. Press the HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON until \u201c Ho\u201d (Hold) is \nshown on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY. \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.       \n4.

Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI 4000s will return to Play Mode.       \n \nWith the above settings, you can change the Program  number only with the HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE \nBUTTON without touching the PR OGRAM KEY.  When you press the HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE \nBUTTON, the current Program number will be shown on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY. Pressing the \nHOLD BUTTON will increase the Program number, and  pressing the OCTAVE BUTTON will decrease the \nProgram number.   If the HOLD BUTTON is functioning as a \u201cProgram  Up\u201d button and the OCTAVE BUTTON is serving its \nnormal function, the OCTAVE BUTTO N will decrease the Program numbe r if you are holding down the \nHOLD BUTTON.  Similarly, if the OCTAVE BUTTON is  functioning as a \u201cProgram Down\u201d button and the \nHOLD BUTTON is serving its normal function, the HOLD BUTTON will incr ease the Program number if you \nare holding down the OCTAVE BUTTON.  \nExample:  When selecting the Program number \u201c10\u201d, if you press the HOLD BUTTON , the Program will be \nchanged to \u201c11.\u201d  If you then press the OCTAVE BUTTON  while still pressing the HOLD BUTTON , the \nProgram will be changed to \u201c10,\u201d and pressing the OCTAVE BUTTON  yet again will decrease the Program to \n\u201c9.\u201d \n\n \n21  \n ADJUSTING THE VOLUMES  \n \n\u0084  Adjusting the Main Volume     \nThis procedure adjusts th e EWI4000s\u2019s main output volume value (01-30). \n 1.

Select \u201c tu\u201d (Tuning) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON. \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  The number \u201c 40\u201d will be shown on the PROGRAM / \nDATA DISPLAY. This means the EWI4000s\u2019s t uning system is set to A440 (i.e., the \nnote \u201cA\u201d is set to 440Hz).   \n4. Set your desired value by pressing the HO LD BUTTON (which increases the value) \nor OCTAVE BUTTON (which decreases the value).  The EWI4000s\u2019s tuning range is \n416Hz \u2013 465Hz.  \n5. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI 4000s will return to Play Mode. \n \nNote:  If you press a button other than the  SETUP BUTTON, HOLD BU TTON, or OCTAVE BUTTON , your \nTuning setting will be ignored and return to the original setting. \n  \n EDITING THE INTERNAL SOUND WITH YOUR COMPUTER \n Parameters of the EWI4000s\u2019s inte rnal sounds and effects cannot be edited or adjusted by the EWI4000s \nitself, but you can do so by connecting to your computer and using the Sound Editor software for the EWI4000s.  The edited sounds and effe cts will be stored in the EWI4000s. \n To edit your internal sounds, connect the EWI4000s to your computer with MIDI cables and download the \nSound Editor for the EWI4000s from our web site ( http://www.akaipro.com\n).  Refer to our website for more \ndetails about this program. \n\n \n29  \n CHAPTER 4: USING THE EWI4000s AS A MIDI CONTROLLER \n \nBecause the EWI4000s has  internal sounds and effects, you can play it on its own,  but you can also it as \nMIDI controller for an external MIDI sound module/synth. \n \n ABOUT MIDI \n MIDI is a standard for transferring the performance data  between electronic instru ments regardless of the \nmanufacturer.  Devices are connected using a 5-pin MI DI cable.  When you c onnect the EWI4000s\u2019 MIDI \nOUT to the MIDI IN of a MIDI s ound module, the EWI4000s\u2019s performance data will be sent to the module, \nwhich plays the sound.  MIDI data is not actual sound \u2013 just data whic h tells the module what sound to \nproduce and how to manipulate it.  MIDI data can be sent over  16 MIDI channels in one MIDI cable.  If you are using an external module, you \nmust set the same MIDI channels fo r the both the EWI4000s and the sound module (whether or not you are \nusing the EWI4000s\u2019s sounds or effects) .  For example, if the EWI4000s\u2019s output channel is set to \u201c1,\u201d the \nsound module\u2019s input channel should also be \u201c1.\u201d \n \nWhen sending MIDI data, the EWI400 0s transmits the Note Number, Ve locity, and some Controller Changes \nsuch as Breath Controller, Portamento, Sustain, etc.  \n1. Connect the MIDI OUT of the EWI40 00s to the MIDI IN of your ex ternal MIDI sound module using a \nstandard 5-pin MIDI cable. \n2. Set the external sound model so that it responds to the incoming MIDI signal.  \n3. Set the received MIDI channel to \u201c1.\u201d  (The EWI4000s is set so that it transfers the MIDI signal with its \ninitial setting.) \n4. Select the sound library you wish to play. \nNote:  Refer to your external MIDI soun d module\u2019s manual for more information.  \n \nTransmitted Information from  the EWI4000s MIDI OUT: \ny Breath strength is transmitted as  MIDI Control Change (CC) #2 (Breath Controller).  If the \nexternal sound module accepts this information, you can control t he output volume of the sound \nmodule with your breath.  Depending on the sound m odule, your breath strength can change not \nonly the output volume but also the character of the sound.  For example, if you set the cut-off \nfrequency of the sound module with  MIDI CC #2, your breath strength can change the sound \ncharacter by changing the cut-off frequency of the sound.  Refer to your sound module\u2019s manual \nfor more information. \ny BEND PLATE information is transmi tted as MIDI Pitch Bend data.  If the external sound module \naccepts this information (i.e., if Pitch Bend is a registered parameter), you can control the sound \nmodule\u2019s Pitch Bend with the BEND PLATE of the EWI4000s.  (The vibrato information is also \ntransmitted as MIDI Pitch Bend data.). \ny GLIDE PLATE information is tr ansmitted as MIDI Control Change #65 (Portamento) and #5 \n(Portamento Time). If the external sound m odule accepts them, you can control the sound \nmodule\u2019s Portamento with the GLIDE PLATE of the EWI4000s.  \n \n \n\u0084  MIDI Program Change     \nYou can change the sound program of an exter nal sound module by sending MIDI Program Change \ninformation from the EWI4000s.  The operation for a Pr ogram Change is the same as \u201cSelecting the Internal \nSounds (Program Key).\u201d  When the Program of the EW I4000s is changed, the MIDI Program Change of the \nsame number is transmitted. \n \n30  \n USING THE EWI4000s AS A MI DI CONTROLLER (APPLICATION) \n \n\u0084  Changing the MIDI Channel     \nThis section explains how to set the MIDI OUT channel of the EWI4000s. \n 1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.   \n2. Select \u201c CH\u201d (Channel) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON.   \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  The current  MIDI channel number will be shown on \nthe PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY. \n4. Select the MIDI channel number you want by pressing the HOLD BUTTO N (which increases the value) \nor OCTAVE BUTTON (which  decreases the value). \n5. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI4000s will return to the Play Mode. \n \nNote:  If you press a button other than the  SETUP BUTTON, HOLD BU TTON, or OCTAVE BUTTON , your \nMIDI channel setting will be ignored and return to the original setting. \n  \n\u0084  Changing the Breath Sensor Output   \n \nThis section explains how to change the EWI4000s\u2019s Breath Sens or output to transmit MIDI Control Change \ndata.  You can select several MIDI Control Changes at the same time. \n \n1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.   \n2. Select \u201c bS\u201d (Breath Sensor) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON.   \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  The currently selected Breath Sensor setting will be \nshown on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY.  The selectable MIDI events are as follows: \n \na. \u201cvo\u201d : Volume (07) \nb. \u201cEP\u201d : Expression (11) \nc. \u201cAF\u201d : Aftertouch \nd. \u201cbr\u201d : Breath control (02) \ne. \u201cvE\u201d : Velocity data \n4. Select the MIDI event you want by pressing the HOLD BUTTON or \nOCTAVE BUTTON. \n5. Press the TRANS BUTTON.  This w ill select whether the MIDI event \nwill be transmitted or not.  If you c hoose to transmit it, an LED in the \nPROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY will light up .  If the LED is not lit, the \nEWI4000s will not transmit the MIDI  event.  You can select several \nMIDI events to tran smit simultaneously.  If you select \u201c vE,\u201d your \nbreath strength will control the MIDI Velocity data. \n6. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EW I4000s will return to the Play \nMode. \n \nNote:  If you press a button other than the  SETUP BUTTON, TRANS \nBUTTON, HOLD BUTTON,  or OCTAVE BUTTON , your MIDI event setting will be ignored and return to the \noriginal setting. \n\n \n31  \n\u0084  Setting the MIDI Velocity Value    \nIf \u201cvE\u201d is selected as the Breath Sensor  output, the EWI4000s will transmit the MIDI Velo city data, which is \ncontrolled by your br eath strength.  If \u201c vE\u201d is not selected, the EW I4000s will a fixed MIDI Velocity value.  You \ncan set a fixed MIDI Velocity as follows: \n 1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.    \n2. Select \u201c vE\u201d (Velocity) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON.\n  \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  The curr ent MIDI Velocity value will be \nshown on the PROGRAM / DATA DISP LAY.  You can select a MIDI \nvelocity between 1 and 127.  Only the lower two digits are displayed.  \nA lit LED on the display means the value shown is over 100.  \n(Example:  If the number \u201c 20\u201d is shown and the LED on the display is  lit, the MIDI Velocity value is \n\u201c120.\u201d)   \n4. Adjust the fixed MIDI velocity y ou want by pressing the HOLD BUTTON (which increases the value) or \nOCTAVE BUTTON (which dec reases the value). \n5. Press the TRANS BUTTON. \n6. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI4000s will return to the Play Mode.   \n  \n\u0084  Changing the Vibrato Sensor Output to Another MIDI Event \n \nBecause the Vibrato Sensor informat ion is mixed with the Pitch Bend information, you can create a pitch-\nbending Vibrato effect by biting the Vibrato Sensor in the MOUTHPIECE.  Alternately, by mixing the Vibrato \nSensor information with the Breath  Sensor information, the Vibrato effect can be created by changing the \nsound\u2019s volume and/or character.  1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.   \n2. Select \u201c vS\u201d (Vibrato Sensor) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON.\n  \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  \u201c Pb\u201d will be shown on th e PROGRAM / DATA \nDISPLAY.   \n4. Select either \u201c Pb\u201d or \u201c bo\u201d by pressing the HOLD BUTTON or \nOCTAVE BUTTON.  \u201c Pb\u201d indicates the Vibrato Sensor information will \nbe mixed with the Pitch Bend information. \u201cbo\u201d indicates the Vibrato \nSensor information will be mixed with t he Breath Sensor information.     \n5. Press the TRANS BUTTON.  This will select whether the MIDI event will be transmitted or not.  If you \nchoose to transmit it, an LED in the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY will light up. \n6. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI4000s will return to the Play Mode.  \n \nNote:  If you press a button other than the  SETUP BUTTON, TRANS BUTTON,  HOLD BUTTON, or OCTAVE \nBUTTON , your MIDI event setting will be ignored and return to the original setting. \n  \n\u0084  Setting the Octave Function (Octave Button) on MIDI Transmit \n \nThe Octave function is available while the EWI4000s is being used as MI DI controller.  While the Octave \nfunction is on, the EWI4000s  transmits a note one octave lower than t he actual note being played (in addition \nto the actual note being played).  To use the Octa ve function on MIDI Transmit, set the OCTAVE BUTTON to \nthe Octave function.  This is described in \u201cAssigning the Octave Function to the Octa ve Button\u201d in Chapter 3. \n \n\n \n32  \n\u0084  Setting the Hold Function (H old Button) on MIDI Transmit  \nThe Hold function is available while the EWI4000s is being used as MIDI c ontroller.  The Hold function on \nMIDI Transmit is a little different t han using the internal sound module.  Th e Hold function is transmitted via \nMIDI in one of two ways, which you can select in the Adjust Mode:  \n1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.  \u201c Ad\u201d will be shown on the PROGRAM / DATA \nDISPLAY. \n2. Select \u201c Ho\u201d (Hold) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON.   \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  The PROGRAM / DATA  DISPLAY will display the current mode.  Use \nthe HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE BUTTON to  select any of the following options: \n \na. \u201cSo\u201d (Sostenuto):  Transmits a MIDI Contro l Change #66. (Sostenuto).  When playing legato  \nnotes with the EWI4000s, the MIDI  Control Change #66 (Sostenuto) w ill be transmitted just after \nthe first note.  Only the first not e will be held \u2013 later notes won\u2019t be held.  When you stop blowing, \nthe Sostenuto will cease. \nb. \u201cSu\u201d (Sustain):  Transmits a MIDI Cont rol Change #64 (Sustain).  When playing legato  notes with \nthe EWI4000s, all notes will be held.  W hen you stop blowing, the Sustain will cease. \nc. \u201cOF\u201d (off):  The Hold function is off. \n4. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI4000s will return to the Play Mode.\n  \n \n \n\u0084  Setting the Glide Plate Function on MIDI Transmit  \n \nThe EWI4000s converts the Portam ento information to MIDI Control Change #65 (Portamento) and #5 \n(Portamento Time) when you touch t he GLIDE PLATE.  However, when some sound modules receive this \ninformation, they may change the sound undesirably.  In this case, turn Portamento off, so you do not \ntransmit Portamento information ev en when touching the GLIDE PLATE. \n \n1. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON.  \u201c Ad\u201d will be shown on the PROGRAM / DATA \nDISPLAY. \n2. Select \u201c Po\u201d (Portamento) by pressing the HOLD BUTTON.   \n3. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  \u201cOn\u201d  will be shown on the PROGRAM / \nDATA DISPLAY. \n4. Select \u201c on\u201d or \u201c OF\u201d by pressing the HOLD BUTTON or OCTAVE \nBUTTON.  \u201c on\u201d will allow the EWI4000s to transmit Portamento \ninformation.  \u201c OF\u201d will not allow the EWI4000s to transmit Po rtamento information, disabling the GLIDE \nPLATE. \n5. Press the SETUP BUTTON.  The EWI4000s will return to the Play Mode.\n  \n \nNote:  If you press a button other than the  SETUP BUTTON, HOLD BU TTON, or OCTAVE BUTTON , your \nMIDI event setting will be ignored and return to the original setting. \n \n \n\u0084  Sending an \u201cAll Notes Off\u201d Message     \nPress the SETUP BUTTON at any time to transmit an \u201cAll  Notes Off\u201d message, which will stop all notes being \nplayed by the EWI4000s.  This is especially us eful if you start encountering \u201cstuck\u201d notes. \n \n \n\u0084  Sending a MIDI Panic Messag e to Reset All Controllers   \nBy pressing the FX BUTTON and LEVEL BUTTON simu ltaneously, you can send a MIDI Panic message, \nwhich will reset all controllers and send an \u201cAll  Notes Off\u201d message on the current MIDI channel. \n \n\n \n33  \n RESTORING THE FACTORY PRESETS \n \nBy turning the EWI4000s on while holding the LEVEL , FX, SETUP, and TRANS BUTTONS, the EWI4000s, \nyou can restore the EWI4000s\u2019s factory preset configuration. \n \nThe following global settings are stored in the \nEWI4000s:  \ndL: Key delay: 07 \nCH: Midi channel: 01 \ntu: Tune: 40 \nbS: Breath Sensor: Aftertouch, breath,  \n      and velocity enabled \nvS: Vibrato Sensor: Pitch Bend enabled \nvE: Velocity: 120 \nPo: Portamento: CC #5 (Pedal Switch off) \nOc: Octave key: oc \nHo: Hold key: OF \nGL: Glide: r \n \nLevel master:  30 \nLevel preset:  30 \n \nReverb master:  21 \n \n\n \n34  \n CHAPTER 5: MISCELLANEOUS NOTES \n \nThis section contains various notes  on the EWI4000s features and func tions that may be helpful as you \nfamiliarize yourself with this unique instrument. \n \n EVI FINGERINGS \n The EVI (electric valve instrument) fingerings may be well suited for bra ss players or reed players who wish \nto experiment more with \u201cbrass-like\u201d fingerings.  This  section explains some important points about how \nthese fingerings work. \n \n\u0084  The Right Hand      \n \nThe right hand controls the three \u201cvalves\u201d as well as  the first Trill Key and third Trill Key (see THE TRILL \nKEYS section for more information).  The right hand  thumb also controls the PITCH BEND BUTTONS.  \nVibrato is created by gently biting the MOUTHPIECE with your teeth.  \nThe right hand index, middle, and ring fingers activate the three \u201cvalve\u201d keys (Keys 8, 9, and 10) as one \nwould on a trumpet or simila r valved brass instrument: \ny Key 8 lowers the pitch two hal f steps (-2) when touched. \ny Key 9 lowers the pitch a half step (-1) when touched. \ny Key 10 lowers the pitch three half steps (-3) when touched. \n The other right-hand keys function differently: \ny Key 7 acts as the first Trill Key which raises  the pitch two half steps  (+2) when touched. \ny Keys 11 and 12 are non-functioning and provide a place to rest the right hand pinky finger. \ny Key 13 functions as the third Trill Key on the EVI. It raises the pitch +4 half steps when touched. \n \nEVI players may be wondering where the second Trill Ke y is. The equivalent of the second Trill Key is \nactivated by the left hand in several ways as explained below.  \n\u0084  The Left Hand       \n \nThe left hand controls the octave, half octave, and sec ond Trill Key.  The left hand thumb also controls the \nGLIDE PLATE.  Grip the EWI4000s with the left hand and keep your fingers on Keys 3 and 4.  This should \nprovide a firm, comfortable grip. \n \nThe left-hand keys function in the following ways: \ny Key 1 represents the canister index finger button on an actual EVI.  Touching it lowers the pitch a \nfourth (-5 half steps).  Think of this key as t he 4th valve on some brass instruments or the left \nhand thumb attachment on a trombone. \ny Keys 2 and 5 are non-functioning keys and acts  as \u201cbarriers\u201d to help prevent glitches. \ny Key 6 acts as the second Trill Key,  which raises the pitch a half st ep (+1/2) when touched.  Lifting \nyour fingers of Key 3 or 4 or touching Key 6 (or any combination of these three keys) raises the \npitch a maximum of a half step (+1/2). \n \n\u0084  T r i l l  K e y s         \nWith only seven right hand fingering combinations and 12 chromatic notes to cover, one must \u201ccrossover\u201d to \nthe next half-octave halfway through the current octave.   \n There are two crossover points where both the right and left hands change at the same time.  One is in the \nmiddle of the octave between G and G#.  The other is betw een C and C#, which is difficult as it requires five \nfinger changes.  Since multiple fingers on both hands are changing simultaneously, these crossover points \ncan be tricky to play or trill between consistently without glitching.  This is why the EVI fingering has the three Trill Keys.  \nThe Trill Keys make several note transitions easier and smoother  to play since they actually raise the pitch.  \nSo, instead of having to move five fingers at exactly the same time to trill from C to C#, you can simply finger a C and use the second Trill Key to play the C#.  Trill Keys can also be used in combination with other Trill Keys or \u201cvalve\u201d keys for alternate fingerings, maki ng difficult musical passages easier to play. \n \n35  \n\u0084  Basic EVI Fingerings       \nHere are a few fingerings to get you started: \ny Place your left thumb between two OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLERS.  C is  played by touching only \nKeys 3 and 4.  (Note that Keys 3 and 4 are normally held down at all times so because there are \nno \u201cvalve\u201d keys held down, this is  considered the \u201copen\u201d fingering.) \ny Now touch your left index finger to Key 1 and you have a G. \ny Use the three right hand \u201cvalve\u201d Keys 8, 9, and  10 to \u201cfinger downwards\u201d from C or G. \ny When fingering down from C, proceed until you get to Ab.  To go from Ab to G, touch your left \nindex finger to Key 1 and release your right hand fingers at the same time. \ny Now proceed to finger down to C#.  To go from C#  down to C, release your left index finger and \nall your right hand fingers and roll your left th umb to the next OCTAVE SHIFT ROLLER all at the \nsame time. \n \nAll fingerings are the same for every octave, though you will have to move along the OCTAVE SHIFT \nROLLERS in different positions.  Right hand fingerings ar e the same as a trumpet in the lower octave from \nmiddle C up to the C on the staff (e.g., C# is always played with Keys 8, 9, 10.  D is always played with Keys \n8, 10, etc.).  You only need to learn this one octave  and you will have mastered the entire range of the \ninstrument!  \n** Special thanks to Matt Traum of Patchman Music ( www.patchmanmusic.com\n) for the development of \nEVI fingering.  \n SOFTWARE UPDATING \n  The EWI4000s\u2019s software is easy to upgrade.  When a new version of software is available, follow these \nsimple steps to load the new software to the EWI4 000s and take advantage of  any new features and \nfunctions we\u2019ve added. \n \nYou will need a computer with a MIDI in terface and some type of MIDI player: \ny Windows:  You can use Windows Media Player 10. \ny Mac OS X:  We recommend downloading SysEx Librarian, a free program available at \nhttp://www.snoize.com/SysExLibrarian/ . \n \n1. Make sure you have your MIDI interface selected in your computer\u2019s controls. \n2. Start by hooking the MIDI OUT from your computer (or MIDI interface connected to your computer) to \nthe MIDI IN of the EWI4000s using a standard 5-pin MIDI cable. \n3. Press and hold the SETUP BUTTON, then press the HOLD BUTTON to  scroll through the menu until \nthe PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY reads \u201c UP.\u201d \n4. Release the SETUP BUTTON.  T he PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY w ill show the current software \nversion. \n5. Open the EWI4000s-vX.Y.mid\u201d file in the MIDI player software on your computer.  (\u201cX.Y\u201d simply \ndenotes the software version you are uploading.) \n6. When the file is finished transmitti ng, the EWI will update its software.  When it is finished, the number \nof the new software version (\u201c XY\u201d) will flash on the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY. \n7. Turn the EWI4000s off.  When you turn it on again,  you will be ready to play  the EWI4000s with the \nlatest software! \n \nIf the PROGRAM / DATA DISPLAY flashes \u201c Er\u201d during the above update procedur e, this means there was \nan error during the transmission of the file.  In some cases \u2013 especially when using lower quality MIDI cables \nor MIDI interfaces \u2013 you may need to retry the procedure a few times before it completes. \n \nIf the problem is relate d to the MIDI player: \ny Windows Media Player users should select th e option to play the MIDI file slowly. \nSysex Librarian users should set the \u201cPause betw een played messages\u201d (in the \u201cPreferences\u201d window) \nbetween 200ms and 300ms. \n \n36  \n TROUBLESHOOTING \n \n\u0084  EWI4000s produces no sound      \n\u0083 Check that the amplifier, mixer, headphones, etc. are properly connected to  the EWI4000s.  Refer \nto the CONNECTIONS section of this manual for more information. \n\u0083 Check that the EWI4000s is powered on, and that  the instrument\u2019s batteries are correctly \ninserted, or that the AC adapter is properly connec ted to the wall outlet and the EWI4000s.

Because we\u2019re continuously striving \nto make your EWI4000s better, the Reference Manua l may not be completely up to date with the \nlatest features. \n \nAll changes affecting the user-interface (i.e., anything the user will see) are listed in this \naddendum.  Internal optimizations, bug fixes, and ot her changes that are transparent to the user \nare not included in this document. \n \nThis addendum covers all changes that ha ve been made since the publishing of the \nReference Manual and covers all changes up to: Version 2.3.   \n \nVersion 2.0 adds many new features to the EW I4000s.  These new features vastly enhance the \nperformance and MIDI control functions of the EWI.  Some of these features change how the \nmenus and other functions work.   \n \nMany of the features in Version 2.0 expand on the Menus of the EWI.  All of the new Menu items \nare accessible via the [SETUP] button.  In order to be able to navigate through these features \nbetter, we have also changed how the Menus wo rk.  In previous versions, when you pressed \n[MENU] you would start off on the \u201cAd\u201d adjustment menu.

The Version 2.0 software  now allows you to select between two \ndifferent modes of operation for the assignment of program changes.   \n \nThe first mode, OF, will disable selecting and sending Program Change messages with \nthe keys. \n  \nThe second mode, OC, allows you to assign a Program Change to each note within a 1 \noctave range.  For example, if you set \u201cG#\u201d  to be program change 32, all G#\u2019s in all \noctave ranges will transmit program change 32 when you combine the G# fingering with pressing the Program Change button and blowi ng in the EWI.  In this mode you get 12 \ndifferent program changes. \n \nWith the third mode, AL (for ALL notes), you can assign a different  program change to \neach of the notes in the full 8 octave range.  This allows access to 96 program changes. \n \nSETTING PROGRAM CHANGE PREFERENCES: \n \n  \nPress the [SETUP] button. \n \nUse the [HOLD] and [OCT] buttons to select  \u201cdP\u201d (Program Change) menu shown on \nthe program/data display. \n \n After selecting \u201cdP\u201d,  release the [SETUP] button. \nYou can now select from two different options using the [HOLD] and [OCT] buttons \nto move through the menu. \n \nPROGRAM CHANGE OPTIONS: \n    \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n>For more information see \u201cAssigning a Program Number to the key note\u201d \nsection of the Operator\u2019s Manual (page 21). \n OF \u2013 (off) \nSelect \u2018OF\u2019 will disable the ability to select and send Program Change \nmessages with the keys. \n \n OC \u2013 (octave) \u2013 Default \nSelecting this option will allow you to assign program changes to the notes \nof only one octave.  This means that same notes in different octaves will transmit the same program change, allowing for 12 different program \nchanges.  \n \n AL \u2013 (all) \nSelecting this option will allow you to assign a unique program change to \nevery note, allowing for 96 different program changes.   \n  \nEWI4000s Manual Addendum v2.3                        13 \n \nFingering Modes \n \nThe EWI4000s now features three additiona l fingering modes.  These fingerings are \nbased on the Akai EVI or Electric Valve In strument fingerings, as well as a Saxophone \nfingering mode.  These fingering modes now al low brass players to play the EWI4000s. \n \nSETTING FINGERING MODE: \n \n  \nPress the [SETUP] button. \n \nUse the [HOLD] and [OCT] buttons to sel ect \u201cFn\u201d (Fingering) menu shown on the \nprogram/data display. \n \n After selecting \u201cFn\u201d, release the Setup button. You can now scroll through and select one of the three different Fingering Modes using the [HOLD] and [OCT] buttons to move through the menu. \n \nFINGERING MODE OPTIONS: \n \n      \n  \n \n            Ei \u2013 (standard EWI fingering) \u2013 Default \nThis is the standard, default fingering system on the EWI4000s.  This \nfingering is based on the fingering of conventional woodwind instruments. \n SA \u2013 (Saxophone fingering) \nThis new fingering mode more accurately  replicates the fi ngerings found on \na standard saxophone.  The G#/low C# key (K5) can now be held down \nwithout affecting any note other than G or the low C fingerings. The Eb key (K11) can also now be held down without affecting any notes other than the \nD fingering.  (K12) is totally ignored in all fingerings except it will drop the \npitch 1/2 step to Bb if you are fingering a low B and add it. \n \nIn this mode the EWI will ignore fi ngers that are two notes below the \nhighest note i.e. If you are fingering an A, none of the right hand buttons will do anything. The exceptions are if you are fingering a B, you can use \nthe F and F# key to finger Bb just like a sax. If you are fingering an F or F#, \nthe D key below will have no affect. \n \nSax players who are shifting from sax to EWI will find this fingering mod much easier to adapt to.  \n Ev \u2013 (EVI fingering) \nThis is another EVI fingering mode which uses the same direction octave \nrollers as the EWI.  This mode may be useful to EWI players who wish to \nexperiment with \u201cbrass-type\u201d fingerings.   \n Er \u2013 (EVI fingering with reverse direction octave rollers) \nThis fingering mode most closely duplicates the movement of the left hand \nwrist on an actual EVI.  We recommend this mode for EVI players.   \nEWI4000s EVI  mode Fingering Charts\n Octa ve Shift Rollers \"Eu\" Mode\nThe \u201c0\u201d position produces t he stan dard pitch.\n Note Keys\n5\n4 3HOLD K3 & K4\nOcta ve Shift Rollers \"Er\" M ode\nThe \u201c0\u201d position pro duces t he stan dard pitc h.14 EWI4000s Manual Addendum v2.3\nK7 K8 K9 K10 K11 K12 K13\nEWI4000s Manual Addendum v2.3                        15 \n \nTHE RIGHT HAND: \nThe right hand controls the 3 \u201cvalves\u201d as well as the EVI 1st Trill Key and EVI 3rd Trill Key.  The \nright hand thumb also controls pitch bend up and down sensors.  Vibrato is done by gently \nwiggling the mouthpiece with your teeth. \nThe right hand index, middle, and ring fingers activ ate the 3 \u201cvalve\u201d keys (keys 8, 9, and 10) as \none would on a trumpet or similar valved brass instrument.  \nKey 8 lowers the pitch -2 half steps when touched.  Key 9 lowers the pitch -1 half step when touched.  Key 10 lowers the pitch -3 half steps when touched. \nKeys 11 and 12 are non-functioning and provide a place to rest the right hand pinky finger. Key 13 functions as the 3\nrd Trill Key on the EVI.  It raises the pitch +4 half steps when touched. \nKey 7 acts as the EVI 1st Trill Key which raises the pitch +2 half steps when touched. \nEVI players may be wondering where the 2nd Trill Key is.  The equivalent of the EVI 2nd Trill Key \nis activated by the left hand in several ways as explained below. \n \nTHE LEFT HAND: \nThe left hand controls the octave, half octave, and EVI 2nd Trill Key (+1/2 step up).  The left hand \nthumb also controls the glide/portamento sensor. \nThe player normally grips the EWI4000s with the left hand and normally touches keys 3 and 4 all \nthe time.  This provides a comfortable firm grip. \nKey 5 is non-functioning and it acts as a \u201cbarrier\u201d to help prevent glitches. Key 6 acts as the EVI 2\nnd Trill Key.  It raises the pitch +1/2 step when touched. By lifting either \nkey 3, or lifting key 4, or touching key 6, or any combination of these three keys, raises the pitch a \nmaximum of +1/2 step.  These three keys are not additive. \nKey 1 takes the place of the canister index finger button on an EVI. Touching  it lowers the pitch a \nfourth (-5 half steps).  Think of this Key as the 4th valve on some brass instruments or the left hand \nthumb attachment on a trombone. \nKey 2 is a non-functioning key and acts as a \u201cbarrier\u201d to help prevent glitches. \n \nTouch the keys filled in.\nThe fingering patterns shown here can be played in all octave ranges.\n  0EWI4000s EVI  mode Fingering Charts16 EWI4000s Manual Addendum v2.3\nK13\nEWI4000s Manual Addendum v2.3                        17 \n \nWHAT ARE TRILL KEYS? \nWith only 7 right hand fingering combinations and 12 chromatic notes to cover, one must \n\u201ccrossover\u201d to the next half octave halfway through the octave. There are two crossover points \nwhere both the right and left hands change at the same time. These points are in the middle of the \noctave between \u201cG\u201d and \u201cG#\u201d and the other is between \u201cC\u201d and \u201cC#\u201d. Since multiple fingers on \nboth both hands are changing at the same time, \u201cC\u201d TO \u201cC#\u201d being the most difficult using 5 \nfinger changes, these crossover points can be tric ky to play or trill between consistently without \nglitching and this is why we have the 3 \u201cEVI  Trill Keys\u201d. The trill keys make several note \ntransitions easier and smoother to play since they actually RAISE the pitch. So instead of having \nto move 5 fingers at exactly the same time to trill from \u201cC\u201d to \u201cC#\u201d, you can simply finger a C and use the 2\nnd Trill Key to play the \u201cC#\u201d. Much easier! As you gain more experience playing the EVI \nfingering mode, you will come to appreciate and use the Trill Keys more and more. Trill Keys can \nalso be used in combination with other Trill Ke ys or \u201cValve\u201d keys for alternate fingerings and \nmaking difficult musical passages easier to play. \n \nBASIC EVI FINGERINGS:  \nHere are a few fingerings to get you started: \nPlace your left hand thumb between two rollers. \u201cC\u201d is played by touc hing only keys 3 and 4. \nNote that 3 and 4 are normally held down at all times so this is considered the \u201copen\u201d fingering \n(no valves down). \nNow touch your left hand index finger to key 1 and you have a \u201cG\u201d. Use the three right hand \u201cValve\u201d Keys 8, 9, and 10 to \u201cfinger downwards\u201d from C or G. When fingering down from C, proceed until you get to Ab. To go from Ab to G simply touch the \nleft hand index finger and release the right hand fingers at the same time . Now proceed to finger \ndown to C#. To go from C# down to C, release the left hand index finger and all the right hand \nfingers and roll your left hand thumb to the next octave roller all at the same time. \nAll fingerings are the same for every octave (except for the octave rollers). Right hand fingerings \nare the same as found on a trumpet in the lower octave from middle C up to the C on the staff. For example C# is always played with keys 8, 9, 10. D is always played with keys 8, 10, etc. You only \nneed to learn this one octave and you will have  mastered the entire range of the instrument! \n    ** Special thanks to Matt Traum from Patchm an Music (www.patchmanmusic.com) for the \ndevelopment of EVI Fingering \n \n \n\n",

    "content": "20 November 2005\n1 of 44UniQuest for EWI \n4000s\nQuick Start\nThank you and congratulations on your choice of the Akai Professional EWI \n4000s Electric Wind Instrument. While the EWI 4000s is equipped with a sophisticated on-board Analog Modeling Synthesizer, UniQuest expands on this feature by giving you remote access to all sound parameters from a connected Mac or PC computer. In addition to complete real-time editor functions, UniQuest for EWI 4000s also serves as a back-up and organizational tool to save and catalog your EWI 4000s sound creations. The editor will also display any notes yo u play on your EWI 4000s in real-time.\n1.0 Getting Ready: Instructions\nUniQuest uses MIDI System  Exclusive messages to communicate with  your EWI \n4000s. This means you\u2019ll need to make certain connections before you install and run the software for the first time. Here we will explain the steps you need to take. Although the illustrations are PC Windows XP based, these instructions also apply to Mac OS X users.\nSystem RequirementsMinimum requirements are a Mac G4 with 256 MB of Ram, or a Pentium III with \n512 MB of RAM. As everybo dy knows, faster is better.\nYou will also need a MIDI interface. fortunately, these can be purchased for under \n$50 these days.\nGetting Ready: Instructions\n2 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sYour computer requires one free MIDI In port and one free MIDI Out port to run \nUniQuest. Please ensure that your MIDI interface is instal led correctly and that all \nfiltering options (especially ones that  affect System Exclusive) are disa-\nbled.\nMake sure your hardware instrument is properly connected to your  computer. Two-\nway (duplex) MIDI communication is essentia l to the UniQuest software's installa-\ntion & operation. You will need to connect two MIDI  cables between your compu-\nter\u2019s MIDI interface and your  instrument as follows:\nOk, this one is pretty obvious. Still, better safe than sorry...\nHere\u2019s where you install the UniQuest software from the CD that shipped with your \nEWI 4000s.  You can also download the so ftware free of charge from the Akai Pro-\nfessional Website (www.akaipro.com). The download will be archived as a zip file.   \nWhen you run UniQuest for EWI 4000s for the first time, you will be prompted to \nchoose the MIDI In port th at the software will use: \nClick on the Yes button to open the MIDI In Ports dialog - Here you will select the \nactual MIDI port that connects to your EWI 4000s. \n \nGetting Ready: Instructions\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 3 of 44You may have noticed that some of UniQuest for EWI 4000s\u2019 dialogs, menu bars \nand icons have the words \u2018Midi Quest\u2019 in  them. This is to be expected, since \nUniQuest for EWI 4000s is built on technology developed by Sound Quest Music Software (www.squest.com). This instrume nt will also available as an included \ninstrument module for users of Sound Quest\u2019s Midi Quest & Midi Quest XL prod-ucts in the near future. \nYou should now see the following choices in the Midi In Ports Dialog: \nIn this illustration, there are 2 MIDI In ports to choose from - Your system will \nshow whatever MIDI ports it has available. For best results when you are using \nother MIDI processing programs in conjunction with UniQuest, your MIDI inter-face should have multi-client  drivers. If you do not see any ports here, your MIDI \ninterface drivers are not correctly installe d and will need correction before you can \nproceed. When you have selected th e MIDI In you want, please click \u2018 Ok\u2019 to pro-\nceed.\nWhen you run UniQuest for the first time, you will also be prompted to choose the \nMIDI Out port that the software will use: \nClick on the Yes button to open the MIDI Out Ports dialog - Here you will select the \nactual MIDI port that connects to your EWI 4000s.\nYou should now see your conn ected MIDI interface ports as  choices in this Dialog\n(your system will  have different MIDI po rts available): Please select the port you \nhave connected to your EWI 4000s\u2019 MIDI in and click Ok.\n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\n4 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sUniQuest will now open. On Windows XP you will see an Application window that \ncontains the Studio Window: \nOn Mac OS X you will see the Application menu and the Studio Window: \nThe studio window contains the EWI 4000s instrument module: This is the main \ninterface used to transfer sound data be tween your EWI 4000s and the software.  \nThe Instrument Module (Windows XP)\n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 5 of 44The Instrument Mo dule (Mac OS X)\nWe\u2019ll now explore the main controls of the instrument module.\n\u2022The Instrument Graphic: More than just a pretty pi cture, this graphic of the \nEWI 4000s can be single-clicked to give  the instrument mo dule focus, and can \nbe double-clicked to upload (or get) the currently selected data from the instru-ment.\n\u007fThe Set List : This control allows you to choose the EWI 4000s data component \nyou wish to work with, such as Preset , Preset Bank  or a more complex grouping \nof components called a Set. On installation, the Set List will have \u2018 Default Set \u2019 \nselected as shown above.\n\u007fThe Action Bar : This bar contains three mini-buttons labeled GET , NEW  and \nOPEN . When you click on one of the mini-b uttons, it will act on the currently \nselected Set List component. For example, to \u2018get\u2019 the preset bank from your EWI 4000s, select \u2018Preset Bank\u2019 in the Se t List and click on the GET mini-button \nwithin the Action Bar.\n\u007fThe Configuration Mini-Button : This mini-button sets the MIDI Port, SysEx \nID, MIDI Channel and other properties of  the currently sel ected component in \nthe Set List. When \u2018Default Set\u2019  is selected in the Set List, this button sets the \ndefault properties of all the components.\nWe\u2019ll get more into the instrument module\u2019s settings later on in this document. For \nnow, it\u2019s important that you configure the module to use the correct MIDI in and out \nports (if you have selected more than one in step 5) and to configure the module to communicate on the same MIDI and SysEx chan nels as your EWI 4000s - If this is \nnot done correctly, UniQuest will not work.\nWhen UniQuest is run for the first time, it searches for your EWI 4000s and sets the \ncorrect MIDI Ports and SysX channel in the instrument module automatically. This process is called AutoSense , and it should not take more than a few seconds if you \nhave selected only one or two MIDI In and Out ports (back in Step 5). \nIf you have selected a single MIDI in a nd MIDI out port, you may not see the Auto-\nSense dialog because it opens and closes too fast to you to notice.  On the other hand \nif you have selected 8 ins and 8 outs (f rom a multi-port MIDI interface for exam-\nple), AutoSense could take longer than 5 seconds to complete. \n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\n6 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sThe AutoSense dialog is shown here: \nIf the AutoSense procedure cannot detect your instrument\u2019s settings, you will need \nto make sure your Midi Interface drivers are installed correctly  and that all cables \nare connected as per the diagram in Step 2. Make sure the output of your computer \nis connected to the input of the EWI 4000s (and vice-versa). Also ensure that no SysEx filtering is enabled on your MIDI interface.\nAlthough UniQuest will now have detected  the correct MIDI Po rts and SysX Chan-\nnel used by your EWI 4000s, you still need to set the MIDI channel manually:\nTo open the default settings dialog for the instrument module, make sure that the \n\u2018Default Set \u2019 is selected in the Set List and then click on the Configuration mini-\nbutton. \n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 7 of 44This will open the default Settings Dialog for the EWI 4000s instrument module :\nThe Port and SysX (Comm) Channel settings will already have been set in this dia-\nlog by the AutoSense procedure. This mean s that the Port In and Port Out settings \ncontrols will be set to the same MIDI ports that AutoSense discovered your EWI 4000s connected to. Likewise , the Comm Ch will be set to the SysEx communica-\ntion channel that your EWI 4000s used to respond to the AutoSense message. \nBy default, the EWI 4000s is configured to use Comm Ch 0 and MIDI Ch 1. \nUniQuest is also configured to these values  by default, so everything will be set cor-\nrectly unless you plan to set your EWI 4000s to a different MIDI channel.\nThe SysEx ID (Comm Ch) used by your EWI 4000s is related to its currently \nselected MIDI channel as follows: A MIDI channel setting of 1 equals a SysEx ID \nsetting of 0, a MIDI channel setting of 2 equa ls a SysEx ID setting of 1,  and a MIDI \nchannel setting of 3 equals a SysEx ID setting of 2, and so on. You must set the Comm Ch to be 1 less than the MIDI Channel in UniQuest\u2019s settings for the soft-ware to work properly!\n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\n8 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sNow you will find out if UniQuest is correctly configured by uploading (or getting ) \nthe Internal Preset Bank from your EWI 4000s . This test is also an essential opera-\ntion since you\u2019ll need to protect these soun ds from accidents while you learn to use \nyour new editor software.\n1. Select \u2018Preset Bank\u2019 wi th the Set List control...\n2. Click on the \u2018Get\u2019 mini-button... \n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 9 of 443. The Preset Bank up loads from your EWI 4000s in about 12 seconds.\n \n4. The Uploaded Data Opens As A Bank Editor Window (Windows XP)\nCongratulations! You have just successfully installed UniQuest EWI 4000s and \nconfigured the software to work with your EWI 4000s. \nPlease save the set you have just uploaded by selecting File : Save EWI 4000s Pre-\nset Bank from the UniQuest application menu. UniQuest will save this data as a file on your computer\u2019s hard drive, and you are now free to explore the sounds you have just transferred to UniQuest by stepping through the bank entries and auditioning each one.\n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\n10 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s1.1 Exploring the Bank Editor Window\nYou can now explore each of the sounds you have uploaded by clicking on an entry \nin the bank window. When you do this, the sound data will be downloaded through MIDI to the EWI 4000s temporary editing buffer, allowing you to audition the cur-rent selection. This will not overwrite any of the EWI 4000s presets, so it is com-pletely safe to do.\nMore interestingly, you can also split the Bank Editor window to see the current \npreset loaded into the Virtual Instrument Interface editor. This is achieved by press-\ning the Bank Editor Window\u2019s Editor-Split  button, which has the icons of 3 faders \nand two knobs on it:\n1.1.1 The Split Bank Window\nOnce the Bank Editor has been split, you can edit the Bank in the left side, and edit \nthe current preset in the right side:\nIf you have not yet selected a preset, nothing will be shown on the right side of the \nsplit.\n\nGetting Ready: Instructions\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 11 of 44Selecting a preset by clicking on it loads the Editor into the right side of the split:\nYou are free to experiment as much as you like - Just remember to save the changed \nbank file under a new name. Otherwise, you will overwrite the backup you just made!\nIn the next section we will explain how UniQuest works in greater detail, and will \nalso explore the Preset Editor \u2019s Virtual Inst rument Interface.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n12 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s2.0 A Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nGetting the most from UniQuest requires a few adjustments in how you relate to \nyour hardware instrument. In  the past you have no doubt  worked entirely \"in-place\" \nwithin the confines of your instrument's internal memory, which means perma-nently overwriting an existing sound before being allowed to listen to another.\nIn typical hardware instruments, the pr esets are organized into banks which are \nstored in \u2018permanent\u2019 memory which is either battery powered (in older instru-\nments) or Flash RAM (in modern instruments).  Simply put, this kind of memory is rewritable but does not get erased if you unplug the instrument. Typical hardware instruments also have an \u2018editing buffer \u2019 where the currently selected preset is \nloaded for editing and auditioning. This memory is temporary - It depends on the instrument remaining powered up. If you turn off the power, the editing buffer will be erased.\nWhen you load a preset, you are actually co pying it to the editing buffer. Similarly, \nWhen you save a preset, you are saving the co ntents of the editing buffer back to the \npreset bank - The destination location is up to you. This mechanism allows you to move presets around in the bank by shuffling them through the editing buffer, but it has a number of drawbacks. Firstly, ther e is only a limited amount of space in the \nbank so moving presets always means ov erwriting others. Secondly, it\u2019s a tedious \nand difficult procedure to move blocks of  presets around this way, and most impor-\ntantly, there is a large possibility for co nfusion and mistakes, which could cause you \nto lose the sound data you are trying to manage and protect! UniQuest eliminates this situation, as we will now see.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 13 of 44With UniQuest, you upload your EWI4000s preset bank to your computer, where it \ncan be safely backed up to your hard drive. Then you are free to edit, audition, step between sounds, reorganize your banks and create searchable sound libraries with complete security and ease. You are never forced to erase useful sounds to make \nroom for new ones with UniQuest. \nOnce you have \u2018Gotten\u2019 the Preset Bank fr om your EWI 4000s, you can save it to \nyour computer\u2019s hard drive and that\u2019s it - Your entire preset bank is now backed up. \nEach time you click on a preset inside the currently open bank editor window, the \npreset is loaded for editing on your comput er while a copy of the preset\u2019s data is \nsent to the EWI4000s\u2019 editing buffer so you can hear the sound change as you edit the preset\u2019s parameters. \nUnlike a hardware instrument, when you st ep to the next preset, the changes you \nmade in the editor are stored in the bank window - They are not lost. This lets you step through your bank editing presets as y ou go. You can also swap entries by drag-\nand-drop operations and can copy and paste presets between different bank editor \nwindows and no permanent memory location on your EWI 4000s will be \nchanged . \nThe only time UniQuest will change the Preset Bank that resides in your EWI \n4000s\u2019 permanent memory,  is when you \u2018Put\u2019 the current bank you are editing back into the EWI4000s. Then, the EWI 4000s\u2019 internal preset bank will become a copy of the bank editor window.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n14 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s2.1 Working with Single Presets\nIf you only want to edit a single preset, UniQuest for EWI4000s has two compo-\nnents designed for this task: Preset  and Preset Edit Buffer :\nWhen either of these compon ents are selected within th e Instrument Module\u2019s Set-\nList, UniQuest will Get, New, Open  or Put a single Preset depending on which \nmini-button you press. \nIn the case of the Preset component, the choice of pres et number within the EWI \n4000s internal bank is set by pressing the configuration mini-button. The default is \n(Pch# 1), which is the first preset  in the internal preset bank. \nIn the case of the Preset Edit Buffer  component, the preset data that is currently \nbeing auditioned by the EWI 4000s in the Edit Buffer is what UniQuest will get or put. This component lets you browse thr ough your EWI 4000s\u2019 internal bank with \nthe program up and down keys on the instrument and upload the current one for sin-gle preset editing whenever you like. The revised sound can then be saved on your computer\u2019s hard drive and can also be saved to the EWI 4000s bank memory by \nperforming the Program Save routine on the instrument.\nNow it\u2019s time to explore the Preset Edit or\u2019s Graphical User Interface and explain \nthe EWI 4000s synthesizer parameters found there.\n2.2 The Preset Editor Window\nWhenever you upload, open or create a new EWI 4000s preset with UniQuest, the \nPreset Editor Window will open. Likewise , whenever you are working with an EWI \n4000s preset bank and split the window, yo u will be accessing the Preset Editor \nthrough the right side of the Bank Window. Every processing section of the EWI 4000s synthesizer and effects architecture is represented here, with real-time con-\ntrols that let you tweak, test and audition the final results as if your EWI4000s was equipped with a separate front panel desktop console. \nAll edits made from this window are instantly downloaded to the EWI 4000s' edit-\ning buffer (temporary memory).\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 15 of 442.2.1 Preset Editor Overview\nThere are 9 sections that make up  the EWI 4000s Preset Editor :\nIn the illustration above, the sections have been separated from their normal layout \nand are shown according to their location in the EWI 4000s synthesizer architec-ture. The black arrows indicate the flow of audio signals within the EWI 4000s.\nWe will now explore each of these sections in greater detail.\n2.2.2 LCD Display\nThe LCD display section shows the curren tly loaded  preset\u2019s name and number \nwithin the bank editor.\nClicking your mouse on the preset name area will open a dialog allowing you to \nrename the preset, while the preset number is display only. If you have opened the \neditor from the Preset component, the pres et number will be whatever is currently \nconfigured in the instrume nt module (default #1). If you  have opened the editor \nfrom the Preset Editing Buff er component there will be not be a preset number dis-\nplayed (--).\nUnderneath the preset name is a 7 octave virtual keyboard display. This keyboard \nwill light up to indicate MIDI notes that are received from the EWI 4000s, so it makes a great tool for working on your fingerings and practicing scales.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n16 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s2.2.3 OSC 1 & 2 SECTION\nThe EWI4000s has two analog modeled oscillators, which are editable independent \nof each other. Each oscillator output s Sawtooth, Triangle and Pulse waves and \nincludes a waveform mixer that lets y ou set how much of each wave is heard.\nOscillator 1 & Oscillator 2 are connected as follows:\nAs you can see there are many different te xtures that you can generate simply by \nadjusting the various level controls. What is not shown in this diagram is the influ-ence of the Breath Threshold and Curve cont rols on each oscillator\u2019s output signal \nlevel - As will be explained, these para meters allow you control each output\u2019s level \nwith the air pressure of your breath.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 17 of 44The following  parameters are common to each oscillator:\nOscillator Tuning ParametersOCTAVE\n\u007fRange is -2 to +2 octaves.\nSEMITONE\n\u007fRange is -12 to +12 semitones.\nFINE\n\u007fRange is -50 to +50 cents. 100 cents = 1 semitone, so this parameter lets you \ndetune the oscillator by as much as a quarter-tone either way. Great for thicken-\ning and doubling the sound.\nBEAT\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%. This is a musical fine detune control. When the two oscilla-\ntors are detuned by a fixed amount with the FINE control, you will discover that \nthere is a subtle \u2018beating\u2019 effect between  them. This beating will be faster for \nhigher pitched notes and slower for lower pitched notes, and this may not be \ndesirable. The BEAT control allows you to detune the oscillators so that the beat-\ning is constant for all notes played.\nOscillator Waveform Parameters\nSAWTOOTH LEVEL ( )\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100 %. Adjusts the oscillator\u2019s sawtooth wave output level.\nTRIANGLE LEVEL ( )\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100 %.

As shown above, negative values cause the sweep to begin at a lower pitch than original, while positive values cause the \nsweep to begin at a high er pitch than original.\nBREATH ATTAIN\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%. As well as triggering the sweep, your breath pressure can act \nas a real-time controller of the sweep pa rameters. This parameter modulates the \nsweep time as follows:\nBREATH DEPTH\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%.

When 1 is se lected, the block of controls in this \nsection govern the settings of OSC FILTER 1. When 2 is selected, these controls \ngovern the settings of OSC FILTER 2. LINK mode is now explained.\nThe Oscillator Filter section consists of 2 multi-mode filters th at are connected in \nserial with each other. Each filter can be set individually or can be linked to realize a \ndouble-strength filter whose parameters are set by filter 1\u2019s controls:\nThe following  parameters are common to  each filter:\nMain Filter ParametersMODEThis control changes the filter\u2019s basic type:\n\u007fOFF : Filter is off, incoming signals are passed unchanged.\n\u007fNTC : Notch - Removes a band of signal content around the filter cutoff \nfrequency. This signal is therefore \u2018notched\u2019.\n\u007fBP: Band Pass - Removes signal content ex cept for a band around the filter cut-\noff frequncy. This band is allowed to pass unchanged.\n\u007fHP: High Pass - Removes signal content be low the filter cutoff frequency. High \nfrequencies are allowed to pass unchanged.\n\u007fLP: Low Pass - Removes signal content above the filter cutoff frequency. Low \nfrequencies are allowed to pass unchanged.\nFREQ\n\u007fRange is 65.5 Hz to 10.5 kHz. This control sets the cutoff frequency of the OSC \nFILTER.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 21 of 44Q-FACTOR\n\u007fRange is 0.5 to 12.7. This control sets  the Quality Factor of the OSC FILTER, \nand is analogous to the RESONANCE control found in typical analog synthe-\nsizer filter sections. \nThe Q Factor of an audio filter is defined as the cutoff frequency divided by the \nbandwidth (the 3dB change in level around the cutoff frequency). While this sounds complicated and rather mathematical, it is easier to understand by comparing how \nthe frequency response curve of a lowpass filter changes with different Q factors: \nAs can be seen, higher Q Factors mean th e filter passes more signal around the cut-\noff frequency while stopping more signal content outside this bandwidth. This also makes the filter more resonant at higher Q factors, which is why the control can also \nbe thought of as a \u2018Resonance\u2019 parameter. \nKEY FOLLOW\n\u007fRange is -12 to 24. When this control is set to 0, the filter\u2019s cutoff frequency \nremains the same for any note played. For all other values of KEY FOLLOW, the \nfilter\u2019s cutoff frequency will be changed based on the current note.\nNote number 72 (which is MIDI Note C 6, and the starting note shown in the 5th \noctave of the LCD keyboard display) is the reference point for the filter cutoff fre-quency: No matter what value KEY FOLLOW is  set to, the filter\u2019s cutoff frequency \nwill apply for this note:\nPositive KEY FOLLOW settings will cause the cutoff frequency of the filter to be \nraised for notes higher than C6 and lowered for notes lower than C6. Negative set-tings have the opposite effect. When KEY FOLLOW is +/- 12, the tracking slope is 1:1 or -1:1 respectively, m eaning that the cutoff frequency will be shifted by the \nsame frequency amount as the the note (relat ive to C6). This produces a very musi-\ncal effect.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n22 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sBREATH MOD\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%. This control allows you to change the filter cutoff frequency \nwith your breath pressure. Higher values apply more modulation to the cutoff \nfrequency.\nBREATH CURVE\n\u007fRange is -50% to +50%. This parameter sets the mapping of breath pressure to \ncutoff frequency for this filter. 0% means a linear 1:1 mapping as follows:\nFilter LFO Parameters\nNot only does each filter have a dedicated LF O that can be used to modulate its cut-\noff frequency, this LFO can be controlled in real-time by your breath pressure for a variety of exciting performance effects.\nLFO FREQUENCY\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%. This co ntrol changes the LFO rate.\nLFO DEPTH\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%. This control changes the amount of LFO modulation that is \napplied to the cutoff frequency. Higher values result in more modulation.\nLFO BREATH\n\u007fRange is -50% to 50%. This control modulates the LFO DEPTH, allowing your \nbreath pressure to control how much LFO modulation is applied to the filter\u2019s \ncutoff frequency. Positive values cause greater breath pressures to result in greater amounts of LFO modulation, while negative amounts of this control cause greater breath pressures to result  in lesser amounts of LFO modulation.\nNote that since negative values of LFO BREATH reduce the amount of LFO Modu-\nlation, LFO DEPTH must be set to 100% to achieve the curve shown in the illustra-tion above.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 23 of 44LFO THRESHOLD\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%. This control sets a point in the breath pressure range that \nacts as a trigger for LFO Modulation to begin or end:\nWhen used in conjunction with the LFO DEPTH and LFO BREATH parameters, \nLFO THRESHOLD can be used to create a variety of sophisticated filter modula-\ntions.\nFilter Envelope ParametersSWEEP TIME\n\u007fRange is 0 to 100%.

When enabled, the Chorus parameters process the signal as follows:\nEach of the two delay lines outputs a delayed pitch modulated copy of the input sig-\nnal. When these output signals are fed back  into the chorus input and recombined \nwith the original signal the result is a wider, doubled sound.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 27 of 44OFF / ON\n\u007fThese buttons disable and enable the chorus effect. When the chorus effect is off, \nthe incoming signal is passed through unaffected.\nFEEDBACK\n\u007fRange is -50% to +50%. This control regulates the amount of chorus output sig-\nnal that is fed back to the input of the delay lines. Negative values apply increas-\ning levels of phase inverted  signal to the input.\nLFO FREQ\n\u007fRange is 0 Hz to 12.7 Hz. Sets the rate of  the LFO that is used by both delay lines \nto apply vibrato (pitch modulation) to their respective signals.\nDRY LEVEL\n\u007fRange is 0 % to 100%.

Controls the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter applied \nto the delay line output. This control allows the delays to have less brightness \nthan the original signal, which is usef ul when simulating natural echo effects.\nLEVEL\n\u007fRange is 0 % to 100%. Controls the output volume of the delay effect.\nReverb Effect Parameters\nThe reverb effect consists of a very long  multi-tap delay line coupled with a lowpass \nfilter for tonal control over the reverber ated signal. Useful for simulating acoustic \nspaces such as rooms, halls, caverns and arenas.\nTIME\n\u007fRange is 1.0 to 5.0 seconds. This control sets the time length of the reverb\u2019s \nmulti-tap delay line.\nDENSE:EARLY\n\u007fRange is 0% to 100%. This control regula tes the density of the early reflections \nproduced by the reverb algorithm. From 0-50% this control increases the number \nof early reflections in the reverb, while from 51-100% it increases the reverb density.\nDAMP\n\u007fRange is -10 to +10. Controls the cutoff frequency of the lowpass filter applied to \nthe reverb output. This control allows the reverberations to have less brightness \nthan the original signal, which is useful when simulating various environments.\nLEVEL\n\u007fRange is 0 % to 100%.

Simply select 2 or more existing presets in your current bank and click on one of the following buttons:\n The Mix button creates a new Bank of Presets by randomly picking param-\neters from 2 or more selected presets. The probability of the parameter coming from each of the selected presets is equal. Each  new preset is a random combination of \nthe selected presets. \n The Blend  button works exactly the same as Mix except that it combines \nlarger chunks of data from each preset t hus maintaining more of their overall aural \ncharacteristics.\nThe Morph  button creates a new bank of pr esets from 2 source presets by \nincrementally transposing the settings of th e first preset through to the second pre-\nset's settings. This function is ideal if you are trying to find a sound that is some-where between two given presets.\nThe Gen4  button opens the Patch Generator 4 Dialog , and is active only \nwhen you select 4 presets  at the same time. The Patch Generator 4 Dialog creates a \nbank of new presets by mixing the parameters  of the four selected presets.  The per-\ncentage of each preset is dete rmined by the loca tion of each of your mouse clicks, as \nshown here:\nIn each case, an entirely new bank of pres ets is generated from the selected source \npresets. You can quickly try out these new presets in your music by auditioning them and keeping the ones you like.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 35 of 442.6 The Set Window\nComponents like Presets,  Edit Buffers and Preset Banks do not have to be edited in \nseparate windows: UniQuest also lets you upload, open or create a combined data \nfile called a Set.  \nThe entire memory space of your EWI 4000s is  represented in the Default Set , \nwhich includes the preset bank, the preset ed it buffer and the individual preset 01.  \nWithin the set window, you can step between each component in the tree-view and \nperform edits with a press of the  button. \nAs with the bank window, presets can also be individually edited by pressing the \nEditor Split button within the patch bank pane of the window:\nIt is important to note that the Set functi onality of UniQuest is not neccessary when \nworking with the EWI 4000s, since this instrument does not have a global settings \neditor or multiple preset banks. If the EWI 4000s did have such a complicated inter-\nnal memory structure the set would be essential to proper sound management. As it is, you will likely find that the Preset Bank  component is all you need to use when \nbacking up and editing sounds on your EWI 4000s.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n36 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s2.7 The Collection Window\nThe Collection window is used to create and edit unstructured groupings of what-\never EWI 4000s components you like. \nJust like the Set and Bank windows, the Collection window will split to show the \nrelevant editor window whenever you sel ect a member of the collection and click \non the Collection\u2019s Editor Split button (as shown here).\nCollections time-stamp components as th ey are added, which means each collection \nacts like a tape-drive that allows you to archive sounds at each stage of development \nand \u201croll back the cloc k\u201d whenever you want.\nCollections can be also used to store your  own structures of data: In the example \nshown above, there are 3 individual  presets and two preset banks. \n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 37 of 442.8 The Library Window\nSince the Bank window is never larger than the maximum size of the your EWI-\n4000s\u2019 internal memory, UniQuest is equipped with a virtually unlimited type of storage: The Library.\nEach library you create can be as big as you like, but can only store one type of data: \nThis is perfect for creating an EWI 4000s Preset Library. The library window also includes a suite of data maintenance and editing tools to keep your arsenal of sounds completely at the ready: In the example shown here, the entire contents of the EWI 4000s factory preset bank have been added to a Preset Edit Buffer Library with one drag-and-drop operation from the Default Set  window. \nLibraries can become extremely large, so  the Library window is capable of per-\nforming key-word searches on as many as six criteria of your choice. Pressing the    \n button launches the Query dialog:  \nIn the example shown above, the Query dialog is set to s earch the library for presets \nwhose name contains the text \u2018brass\u2019 and who have the keywords \u2018Tuba\u2019 or \u2018Trum-pet\u2019 stored with their entry.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n38 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sThe result of this Query is now shown: \nYou will see that there seem to be duplicate results in this query. A new Query can \nbe run on the results, set to remove thes e duplicates. This i nvolves pressing the  \nbutton again and checking the \u2018 Duplicates \u2019 option in the Query Dialog. Here is the \nnew result: \nThe \u2018Duplicates\u2019 option actually compares the data bytes of every preset and only \nshows one copy of each duplicate found - A very useful tool when you are not sure \nyourself. Please note that the library still contains the or iginal number of presets. \nQueries simply hide any presets that are not returned. To reset the library to show all \nentries, simply click on the  button. \nFrom a single library window you can search the sounds you need by their name or \nby the automatic keys UniQuest inserts in each library entry when it is entered. You \nare also free to audition each patch by clicking on it, as well as mix, blend, morph \nand Gen4 new banks from the currently selected patches.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 39 of 442.9 Transferring Presets Between Windows\nIt is easy to transfer presets between any open editor window in UniQuest. In most \ncases where the source is a bank window, you need only drag and drop the entry to a new location such as another bank window, a library window (of the same type), a collection window, or an open preset editor window.\nWhen the source is an open preset editor window, a simple drag and drop operation \nwill not work, however. In this case, you must hold down the Alt key  while clicking \n(Alt-Click ) the mouse on the open preset editor window. You may then release the \nAlt key and continue to drag and drop the preset data to the destination as before. \n2.10 The \u2018Update Patch on Activate\u2019 Option\nWhen UniQuest for EWI 4000s is first installed, the Update Patch on Activate  \noption is enabled. This preference contro ls how the program communicates with \nyour EWI when multiple editor windows are open. Consider the followingscenario:\nThere are four open windows in this illustrati on, and each one contains a different \npreset for editing. Since the window containing the FA T SAW preset currently has \nfocus (is selected for editing), you should expect the EWI 4000s editing buffer to contain this preset so that you could hear your sound edits as you work. \nWith Update Patch on Activate  enabled, you can switch between each of these \nfour open windows and always be sure that the current window\u2019s data is loaded into the EWI 4000s because UniQuest will put the data to the instrument every time  you \nswitch to a new window.\nIn the situation above, selecting the window  that is editing the FAT SAW preset will \nautomatically put the preset into your EWI 4000s\u2019 edit buffer. If you were then to \nselect the Collection window, the current selection in this window (SAW+5) would replace FAT SAW in the EWI so that you c ould hear any changes you made within \nthe collection editor window. Similarly, if you then selected the Bank window for editing, the current selection in this  window (BRIGHT SYNTH) would replace \nSAW+5 in the EWI 4000s\u2019 editing buffer. \nSince single preset data is quickly transf erred between UniQuest and your EWI, the \nUpdate Patch on Activate  preference is best left enabled.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n40 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s2.11 The \u2018MIDI Thru\u2019 Feature\nBy default, UniQuest\u2019s MIDI Thru feature is turned off.  If you wish to create EWI \nsounds for layering with external synthe sizers and samplers, how ever, you will need \nto enable this feature.\nBefore you can use the MIDI Thru feature, you need to ensure that your computer \nhas a second MIDI port for connecting the external instrument to UniQuest. Here is how the EWI 4000s, the computer and the external synth or sampler will need to be connected for this application:\nPlease note that your external synth or sa mpler may have a USB Midi feature, in \nwhich case you can simply connect the inst rument to your computer with a USB \ncable and install the MIDI dr ivers that came with the in strument on your computer.\nOnce you have connected the external synth or  sampler, you will need to make sure \nthat UniQuest for EWI 4000s is configured to use the MIDI port the external device \nis connected to: Open the MIDI->MIDI in Ports...  and MIDI->Midi Out Ports..  \ndialogs respectively an d select these ports in addition  to the ones already connected \nto the EWI 4000s.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 41 of 44Next, open the UniQuest Preferences dialog ( UniQuest for Akai EWI4000s-\n>Preferences  on Mac, or Options->Preferences  on Windows). Now select the \nMIDI  Tab of the dialog:\nTurn on MIDI Thru and then select the MI DI Port Out to route the MIDI Thru sig-\nnals to. This selection must be the port to which the external synth or sampler is connected.\nDo NOT select the same port that the EWI 4000s is already using. This will create a \nMIDI Feedback loop and cut the note output of the EWI 4000s\u2019 synthesizer in half!\nIf you are not using an external device w ith UniQuest, turn the MIDI Thru feature \nOFF, or you may experience this problem by default.\nIf the correct output port is not shown in the Midi Port Out  control, the external \ndevice\u2019s MIDI Port may not be selected for use with UniQuest (see above for instructions) or the port\u2019s drivers may not be correctly installed. Please refer to your MIDI interface or external device (if equipped with USB MIDI) installation instruc-\ntions to correctly install these drivers and try again.\nWhen properly configured, the following MIDI control flow will occur:\n\u007fNotes and other MIDI performance data performed on EWI 4000s will enter the \neditor where it will be displayed as it is passed through to the external synth or \nsampler which will play along with the EWI 4000s.\n\u007fAll edits performed within the software  GUI will generate MIDI SysEx and \nNRPN data which will be passed to the EWI 4000s only.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\n42 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000s2.12 Transferring Data Files Between Different Computers\nThere are a few facts to keep in mind wh en transporting Preset, Bank and Set data \ncreated by UniQuest between different comput ers. If you plan to email these files or \nmove them between Mac and PC computers, you should be aware of the following facts.\nOn Windows 2000 & XP, file extensions  are used to indicate the data contained \nwithin the file and to cue the operati ng system which application should be \nlaunched when the file is double-cli cked or otherwise interacted with. \nUniQuest for EWI 4000s uses the following extensions:\n      .Mem  - Preset Edit Buffer,\n      .Prs  - Individual Preset (from internal Bank), \n      .Bnk  - Preset Bank,\n      .SQS  - Set File,\n      .SQC  - Collection File, and\n      .SQL  - Library File\nThe file extensions listed here are also us ed by the Mac OS X version of UniQuest, \nbut this is not the whole picture, as will now be explained.\nMac OS X relies on File Type  and File Creator  properties embedded within the file \nto provide the information required when the file is double-clicked or interacted \nwith. \nUniQuest for EWI 4000s uses the following file Type and Creator properties:\nDATA\nTYPE CREATOR\nPreset Edit Buffer SQDA SQUQ\nIndividual Preset SQDA SQUQ\nPreset Bank SQDA SQUQ\nSet File SQST SQUQ\nCollection File SQDB SQUQ\nLibrary File SQLB SQUQ\n\u007fIf you create any of the above data files with the PC version of UniQuest, they \nwill not have these properties set (Windows does not support them). As a result, \nMac versions of UniQuest will not be able to open the files - They will appear gray and transparent in the \u2018file open\u2019 dialog.\n\u007fLikewise, if you email any of the above data files as raw attachments, their Type  \nand Creator  properties will be stripped off - Ev en if they were created on the \nMac!\nThe solution to the email problem is simple: Simply remember to archive any Mac \nUniQuest data as a zip or binhex archive prior to attaching them , and always ensure \nyou decompress the archive on a Mac running OS X. Both Mac and Windows com-puters will be able to load them if transferred this way.\nConverting UniQuest data files created on PC  for use with the Mac version is more \ndifficult: Currently, the Mac OS X Get Info  program does not show or set these file \nattributes. If your Mac is equipped with OSX Tiger, there is a way to do this with Automator : Otherwise, you may need to use a third-party shareware utility to do the \nconversion.\nThe next paragraphs will explain how to use OSX Tiger\u2019s Automator application to \nconvert files from PC or email to the correct file Type and Creator properties.\n\nA Quick Tour of UniQuest For EWI 4000s\nUniQuest for EWI 4000s 43 of 44Mac OSX\u2019s Automator utility can be applied to the task of converting UniQuest \nfiles from the PC version relatively easily. You will need:\n\u007fMac OSX Tiger (which includes Automator)\n\u007fThe Change File Type and Creator  Action from \nwww.apple.com/download s/macosx/automator/changefiletypeandcrea-\ntor.html . \nIf this URL has been change d, you should search for \u2018 Change File Type and \nCreator \u2019 on the www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/automator/  web page to \naccess the download.\n\u007fThe following workflow files downloadable from  http://www.psicraft.com/\nFiles/AkaiPro/Automator%20Actions.zip\nThe first step is to install the \u2018Change File Type and Creator\u2019 Action into Automa-\ntor. Actions are like audio plug-ins: They extend Automator do do specific tasks.\nNext, extract the \u2018Automator Actions.zip\u2019 download to your desktop. Inside the \narchive are four Workflow files: Set PC Collection , Set PC Preset  and Bank , Set \nPC Set  and Set PC Library . When each file is opened w ith Automator, you will be \nready to convert the appropriat e data file so that the file Type and Creator attributes \nare set correctly. \nSince Presets and Banks are the most common  data type produced by UniQuest for \nEWI 4000s, here is an illustrated example of the procedure:\nOn opening the \u2018Set PC Preset and Bank\u2019 Workflow file, you wi ll see the above dia-\nlog open. Simply click on the \u2018 Run\u2019 button to start the Workflow. \nNever click the \u2018Select file\u2019 button in th e \u2018Change File Type and Creator\u2019 action: \nThis will only change the workflow so that it no longer sets the correct type and cre-ator attributes.\nOnce the Run button has been pressed, Auto mator will execute the first action in the \nworkflow, which is \u2018 Ask for Finder Items \u2019. This will launch a file selection dialog \nthat will open to the default folder where Preset and Bank  data files are stored by \nUniQuest for EWI 4000s:\n\nConclusion\n44 of 44 UniQuest for EWI 4000sIn the illustration above, there are three bank files that al ready have the correct file \ntype and creator attributes set (which is why they show the bank icon). \nThe top two bank files (which are selected in the illustration) do not have their \nattributes set correctly - Th eir icons (the blank document icon) reflect this fact.\nClicking \u2018Choose\u2019 will continue the workflow, setting the selected files to the \nproper attributes. Automator will indicate \u2018 Workflow Execution Completed \u2019, and \nthe files will now open within the Mac version of UniQuest.\nHere you can see the finder\u2019s view of the folder after the workflow completed:\nThe processed bank files are now showing the correct icon and document type.\n3.0 Conclusion\nThis concludes the UniQuest for EWI 4000s Quick Start. You are encouraged to \nread through the complete PDF owner\u2019s manual for Midi Quest XL (found on the installation CD) to master UniQuest\u2019s d eeper capabilities. We hope your music is \nenriched and enhanced by this innovative and unique music software, and also would like to thank you for reading the entire Quick Start.

Use the \nmouthpiece cover after using or  while carrying the EWI5000. \n\u2022 Always touch the grounding plate an d octave rollers when playing.  These are sensors \nwhich use the performer's body as the ground. \n\u2022 Keep the mouthpiece clean  before, during, and after using the EWI5000. You can clean its \nouter surface with a sl ightly damp cloth. \n \n1. Power the EWI5000 \n \nThe EWI5000 is powered by a r echargeable battery. Please note the following about using it:  \n\u2022 Installation:  Use a standard Phillips-head screwdriver (not included) to re move the EWI5000's \nbattery compartmen t cover below the Phones  output, install the ba ttery, and re-secure the \ncover. \n\u2022 Charging:  Use the included USB cabl e to connect the EWI5000's USB port to either (A) the \nincluded USB power adapter, conn ected to a power source or (B) an available USB port on \nyour computer (powered on).  You can charge the battery while using the EWI5000. \n\u2022 Battery life:  Check the battery life by pressing and holding the Level Button  and then pressing \nand holding the FX Button . The amount of battery life ( 00\u201399) will appear in the display. \n\u2022 Low-battery warning:  When the battery power is low, the Preset LED  or User LED  will blink \nto indicate that you shou ld charge the battery. \n\u2022 Auto-power-off:  If the EWI5000 detects no  activity for approximately 10 minutes , it will power \noff automatically. In general, though, power off th e EWI5000 to preserve its battery life when \nyou are not using it. \n \n2. Hold the EWI5000 \n \n1. Secure the neck strap to th e EWI5000's neck strap mount. \n2. Place the strap around your  neck and hold the EWI5000 in the same way \nyou would hold a saxophone or clarinet, with the instrument ve rtically right in \nfront of you. \n3. When playing, place your left thumb on  the octave rollers in the back, and \nplace your right thumb on the gro unding plate between  the pitch-bend \nplates. This will ensure the best possib le conductivity and performance of \nthe instrument.  Important: Download the full \nEWI5000 User Guide  and \nEWI5000 editor software from: \nakaipro.com/ewi5000  \n \n4  \n3. Connect \n \nImportant:  The scenarios below are not mutually exclusive. The EWI5000 sends out audio \nfrom its Line Out , from its Phones  jack, and wirelessly to the receiver (if it is paired) all at the \nsame time . You can, for example, play EWI5000's audio wirelessly while also listening through \nthe headphones. The exception is when the EWI5000 is connected to your computer and \npowered off (the fourth scenario in this section): it will send MIDI messages to your computer \nbut not send any audio. \n \nLINE OUT PAIRED/POWER L R\n To play EWI5000's audio wirelessly: \n1. Use the included USB cable to connect the wireless \nreceiver to your computer (powered on). Alternatively, \nconnect the receiver to the included USB power \nadapter, and connect the adapter to a power outlet. \nThe receiver's Pair LED  will flash. \n2. Press the EWI5000's Power Button  t o  p o w e r  i t  o n .  \nThe Preset  LED next to its Bank Button will flash. \n3. Set the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  to On. It will \nautomatically \"pair\" to the wireless receiver. When \npaired, the receiver's Pair LED  and the EWI5000's \nPreset LED  or User LED  will light solid. The wireless \nreceiver will now send the EWI5000's audio to your \ncomputer. (The wireless recei ver's Line Outs will not \nplay the signal from your computer.) \nNote:  If the connection is lost, you can manually pair \nthe EWI5000 to the receiver by  pressing the receiver's \nPair Button  and then pressing the EWI5000's Power \nButton  once. \n \n To play EWI5000's audio through an external amplifier, \naudio interface, etc.: \n1. Use a standard 1/4\" (6.35mm) cable to connect the \nEWI5000's Line Out  to the line-level input of your \nkeyboard amplifier, audio interface, etc. \nImportant: The Line Out  is a stereo output. If you are \nconnecting to a mono input (like those on most \nkeyboard amplifiers, audio interfaces, etc.), use a TS \ncable instead of a TRS cable. \n2. Press the EWI5000's Power Button  to power it on. \n3. Set the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  to Off.  \n \n \n  \nTo play EWI5000's audio through headphones: \n1. Connect standard 1/8\" (3.5mm) stereo headphones to \nEWI5000's Phones  jack. \n2. Press the EWI5000's Power Button  to power it on. \n3. Set the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  to Off.  \n or or \n \n5  \n To play EWI5000 as a \"wired\" MIDI controller: \n1. Make sure EWI5000 is powered off. If it is not, press \nand hold the Power Button  for a full second. \n2. Use the included USB cable to connect the \nEWI5000's USB port to your computer. \n3. Make sure the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  is set to \nOff.  \n \n \n \n4. Play! \n Hold the mouthpiece gently between your lips with your teeth, and exhale so your breath \npasses through both sides of your mouth. The EWI5000 detects this wind pressure with the \nbreath sensor and expresses the change in sound volume and character, depending on how \nyou blow. (It should not take much br eath to activate the instrument.) \nTips: \n\u2022 There is a bite sensor in the mouthpiece. You can produce a vibrato effect by gently \nbiting the mouthpiece, which will bend the pi tch up each time you bite, but do not bite \ntoo hard. \n\u2022 You can create small bursts of air by tonguing the mouthpiece for even more expressive \ncontrol. \n\u2022 If the EWI5000's note keys, octave rollers, pitch-bend plates, or glide plates are not very \nresponsive, it could be  because you are playing with dr y hands (the EWI5000 works by \nusing the body's capacitance). If this happen s, you can use a very small amount of non-\ngreasy hand lotion to improve the connection between your hands and the keys. \n \nNote Keys: The note keys are sensors that let you produce sound \nwith only a light touch. The EWI5000 has multiple fingering \noptions, so it can feel familiar to saxophonists, flutists, etc. You \ncan adjust the position of the three lowest keys by loosening the \nscrews that hold each of them in place.  \nOctave Rollers: Place your left thumb between any two octave \nrollers (and ov er the grounding plate) on the EWI5000's back \npanel. Slide your thumb up or down across the octave rollers to \nshift its octave range up or down. While playing, keep your left \nthumb in contact with the octave  rollers. The position between \nthe two knurled octave rollers indicates the standard pitch.  \nGlide Plate:  While playing a note, move your thumb across the \noctave rollers (without rolling them) while touching the glide plate \non their right side to create a \"glide\" effect. This will smoothly and \ncontinuously slide the pitch up or down\u2014a technique known as \nportamento . \nPitch-Bend Plates: Touch your thumb to either of these plates to \nmove the pitch of the note you are playing up or down. Touch the upper plate to bend the pitch upward or the lower plate to bend \nthe pitch downward. Before you get accustomed to using these \nplates, you may produce unexpected sounds by touching them \naccidentally. You can adjust the position of each plate by \nloosening its screw. Pitch-Bend\nUp\nPitch-Bend\nDownStandard \nPitch Glide \nPlate \n \n6  \nFeatures \n \n1. Mouthpiece:  Hold the mouthpiece gently \nin between your lips with your teeth and \nexhale into it (like a traditional wind \ninstrument). You can produce a vibrato \neffect by gently biting the mouthpiece \nwhile blowing into it, but do not bite too \nhard . \n2. Note Keys:  Press these keys in different \ncombinations while blowing into the \nmouthpiece to determine the note. You \ncan adjust the position of the three lowest \nnote keys by loosen ing their screws. \n3. Hold Button:  Press this button to enter \nHold Mode.

Line Output:  Use a 1/4\" TRS cable to connect this output to the input of a keyboard \namplifier, audio interface, speaker system, etc. \nImportant: The Line Out  is a stereo output. If you are connecting to a mono input (like \nthose on most keyboard amplifiers, audio interfaces, etc.), use a TS cable instead of a \nTRS cable. \n25. USB Port:  Use a standard USB cable to connect this port to an available USB port on \nyour computer. This connection will power the EWI5000 and charge its battery as well as send MIDI messages to your computer. \n \n8  \nAdvanced Functions \n \nSound and Sensor Adjustment \n \nYou can adjust the EWI5000's sounds to your preference \nby using (1) the included sound editor software and/or (2) \nEWI5000's eight parameter knobs (remove the cover \nabove the display to expose the knobs). \n \nThe eight parameter knobs control some of the basic \ncharacteristics of either  the Program or the EWI5000 \nitself, as described below. \n \n \nEach Parameter Knob, except for Fine, has a primary and secondary function. Access the \nprimary function by simply turning the knob. Ac cess the secondary function by pressing and \nholding the Trans Button and then turning the knob. \n \nFilter  Primary:  sets the Program's filter cutoff frequency. \nSecondary:  sets the Program's filter resonance. \nBreath  Primary:  sets the EWI5000's breath sensor offset (how much breath is required to play a \nsound). \nSecondary:  sets the EWI5000's breath sensor's gain (how loudly or quietly you can play; \na higher setting decreas es the dynamic range). \nBite Primary:  sets the EWI5000's bite sensitivity (h ow much biting the mouthpiece affects the \nsound). \nSecondary:  sets the amount of Delay e ffect applied to the Program. \nSemi Primary:  sets the EWI5000's tuning by semitones (half-steps). \nSecondary:  sets the rate of the Delay effect applied to the Program.  \nFine Primary:  sets the EWI5000's tuning by fractions of a semitone. \nSecondary:  no function.  \nReverb Primary:  sets the amount of Reverb effect applied to the Program. \nSecondary:  sets the room size of the Reve rb effect applied to the Program.  \nChorus  Primary:  sets the amount of Chorus e ffect applied to the Program. \nSecondary:  sets the depth of the Chorus e ffect applied to the Program. \nLFO Primary:  sets the amount of modulation  (CC#1) applied to the Program. \nSecondary:  sets the frequency of the modulation's low-frequ ency oscillator for the \nProgram.  \n \nIf you like the adjustments you have made and wa nt to save them to the Program, press the \nSave Button . \nImportant:  When saving, only the settings that apply to the Program will be saved. Settings \nthat apply to the EWI5000 will affect all Programs  because they affect the sensors and tuning \nof the EWI5000 hardware itself. \nTip: To further customize your sound, use the EWI 5000 sound editor software to adjust even \nmore Program parameters, and use the parameters knobs' additional functions to adjust the \nEWI5000's sensors.

El EWI5000 detecta la presi\u00f3n de este viento con \nel sensor de aliento y expresa el cambio en volume n y car\u00e1cter del sonido, seg\u00fan c\u00f3mo sople. (No \nnecesitar\u00e1 demasiado aire par a activar el instrumento). \nConsejos: \n\u2022 Hay un sensor de mordedura en la boquilla. Puede producir un efecto de vibrato mordiendo \nsuavemente la boquilla, que producir\u00e1 una infle xi\u00f3n de pitch hacia arriba cada vez que muerda, \npero no muerda demasiado fuerte. \n\u2022 Puede crear peque\u00f1as r\u00e1fagas de ai re produciendo un aleteo o ar ticulaci\u00f3n de la punta de la \nlengua en la boquilla para lograr un control a\u00fan m\u00e1s expresivo \n\u2022 Si las teclas de nota, rodillos de octava o placas de inflexi\u00f3n de pitch del EWI5000 no \nresponden muy bien, podr\u00eda deberse a que est\u00e1  tocando con las manos secas (el EWI5000 \nfunciona utilizando la capacitancia del cuerpo).   Si esto ocurre, puede usar una muy peque\u00f1a \ncantidad de loci\u00f3n para manos no oleosa para me jorar la conexi\u00f3n en tre sus manos y las \nteclas. \n \nTeclas de nota: Las teclas de nota son sensores t\u00e1ctiles que le \npermiten producir sonido con solo un ligero toque. El EWI5000 \nposee varias opciones de digit aci\u00f3n, de modo que puede resultar \nfamiliar para saxofonistas, flautist as, etc. Es posible ajustar la \nposici\u00f3n de las tres teclas m\u00e1s bajas aflojando los tornillos que las sostienen en su sitio.  \nRodillos de octava: Coloque su pulgar izquierdo entre dos rodillos \nde octava cualesquiera (y sobre la  placa de puesta a tierra) en el \npanel posterior del EWI5000. De slice su pulgar hacia arriba o abajo \na lo largo de los rodillos de octa va para desplazar hacia arriba o \nabajo la gama de octavas. Mien tras toca, mantenga su pulgar \nizquierdo en contacto con los rodi llos de octava. La posici\u00f3n entre \nlos dos rodillos de octava molet eados indica el pi tch est\u00e1ndar.  \nPlaca de deslizamiento:  Mientras toca una no ta, mueva su pulgar \npor los rodillos de octava (sin hacer los girar) mientras toca la placa \nde deslizamiento de su lado der echo para crear un efecto de \n\"deslizamiento\". De esta forma el pitch se deslizar\u00e1 suave y \ncontinuamente hacia arriba o abaj o \u2014una t\u00e9cnica conocida como \nportamento . \nPlacas de inflexi\u00f3n de pitch: Toque con el pulgar de estas placas \npara subir o bajar el pitch de la nota que est\u00e1 tocando. Toque la \nplaca superior para realizar la infl exi\u00f3n de pitch hacia arriba o la \ninferior para realizar la infle xi\u00f3n de pitch hacia abajo. Antes de \nacostumbrarse al uso de estas placas, es posible que produzca \nsonidos inesperados al tocarlas accidentalmente. Puede ajustar la \nposici\u00f3n de cada placa aflojando su tornillo.

Appuyez sur la touche d'alimentation ( Power ) afin de mettre \nle EWI5000 sous tension. \n3. R\u00e9glez l\u2019interrupteur Wireless  du EWI5000 sur \u00ab Off \u00bb.  \n ou \nou \n \n19  \n Pour utiliser le EWI500 0 comme contr\u00f4leur MIDI\nbranch\u00e9 : \n1. Veuillez vous assurer que le EWI5000 soit hors \ntension . Si tel n\u2019est pas le cas, maintenez la touche \nd\u2019alimentation ( Power ) enfonc\u00e9e pendant 1 seconde. \n2. Utilisez le c\u00e2ble USB inclus afin de brancher le port \nUSB du EWI5000 \u00e0 votre ordinateur. \n3. R\u00e9glez l\u2019interrupteur Wireless  du EWI5000 sur \u00ab Off \u00bb. \n \n \n4. Jouez ! \n \nTenez d\u00e9licatement le bec entre vos l\u00e8vres avec vos dents et soufflez pour que le souffle \npasse par les deux extr\u00e9m it\u00e9s de votre bouche. Le EWI5000 d\u00e9 tecte la pression de ce souffle \npar son capteur et exprime le changement en termes de volume et de caract\u00e8re de son. (Il \nn\u2019est pas n\u00e9cessaire de souffler tr\u00e8s fort afin d\u2019activer l\u2019instrument.) \nConseils : \n\u2022 Le bec poss\u00e8de un capteur de vibrato. Vous  pouvez produire un effet de vibrato en \nmordant d\u00e9licatement le bec, ce qui a pour effet de modifier la hauteur tonale chaque fois \nque vous mordez. Ne mordez pas trop fort. \n\u2022 Vous pouvez cr\u00e9er de petites salves d\u2019air par effet de langue sur le bec pour un contr\u00f4le \nencore plus expressif. \n\u2022 Si les cl\u00e9s, les galets de transposition d\u2019octave ou les plaques de variation tonale ne \nr\u00e9pondent pas correctement, il se peut que vos mains soient trop  s\u00e8ches (le EWI5000 \nfonctionne avec la capacitance du corps humain). Utilisez une petite quantit\u00e9 de lotion \npour les mains non grasse afin d\u2019am\u00e9liorer la connexion entre vos mains et les touches. \n Cl\u00e9s : Les touches des notes sont des capteurs qui vous permettent de produire des sons \navec un toucher l\u00e9ger. Le EWI5000  a plusieurs options de doigt\u00e9, alors il est fort possible que \nles saxophonistes, les fl\u00fbtistes, etc., se sentent en terrain connu. Vous pouvez r\u00e9gler la \nposition des trois derni\u00e8res cl\u00e9s en desserrant les vis qui les retiennent.  \nGalets de transposition d\u2019octave : Placez votre pouce gauche \nentre deux galets quelconques (et sur la prise de terre) \u00e0 l\u2019arri\u00e8re du EWI5000. Pour augmenter ou  diminuer la plage d\u2019octave, \nd\u00e9placez votre pouce vers le haut ou vers le bas sur les galets. \nPendant le jeu, vous devez garder votre pouce gauche en contact \navec les galets de transposition d'octave. La position occup\u00e9e \nentre les deux galets molet\u00e9s vo us donne la hauteur standard.  \nPlaque de glisse :  En jouant une note, d\u00e9placez votre pouce sur \nles galets de transposition d'octave  (sans rouler) tout en touchant \nla plaque de glisse sur leur c\u00f4 t\u00e9 droit pour cr\u00e9er un effet de \n\u00ab gliss\u00e9 \u00bb, qui fait monter ou descendre progressivement et de \nfa\u00e7on continue la hauteur, technique \u00e9galement connue sous le nom portamento . \nPlaques de variation tonale : Touchez du pouce une de ces \nplaques afin de hausser ou baisser la variation tonale de la note jou\u00e9e. Touchez la plaque sup\u00e9rieure  pour hausser la tonalit\u00e9 ou la \nplaque inf\u00e9rieure pour baisser la tonalit\u00e9. Avant de ma\u00eetriser ces \nplaques, il peut vous arriver de pr oduire des bruits inattendus en \nles touchant accident ellement. Vous pouvez aussi r\u00e9gler la \nposition de chaque plaque en desserrant leur vis.

Servirsi del tappo \nper il bocchino dopo l'uso o qu ando si trasporta l'EWI5000. \n\u2022 Toccare sempre le piastre di terra e gli octave roller quando si suona.  Questi sono sensori che \nutilizzano il corpo di chi suona come terra. \n\u2022 Mantenere il bocchino pulito  prima, durante e dopo l'uso dell'EWI5000. \u00c8 possibile pulirne la \nsuperficie esterna servendo si di un panno bagnato. \n \n1. Accendere l'EWI5000 \n L'EWI5000 \u00e8 alimentato tramite una batteria ricaricabile. Va  notato quanto segue, in merito al suo utilizzo:  \n\u2022 Installazione:  servirsi di un cacciavite a croce (non in dotazione) per rimuovere il coperchio dello \nscomparto batterie dell'EWI5000 presente sotto l'uscita Cuffie , installare la batteria e stringere \nnuovamente il coperchio. \n\u2022 Ricarica:  servirsi del cavo USB in dotazione per collegare la porta USB dell'EWI5000 (A) all'adattatore \ndi alimentazione USB in dotazione, collegato a una fonte di alimentazione o (B) ad una porta USB \nlibera del computer (acceso).

In generale, tuttavia, spegnere l'EWI5000 per risparmiare la batteria quando non \u00e8 \nin uso. \n \n2. Impugnare l'EWI5000 \n 1. Fissare la fascia da collo all'EWI5000. \n2. Porla intorno al collo e reggere l\u2019EWI5000 allo stesso modo in cui si reggerebbe \nun sassofono o un clarinetto: con lo strumento verticale di fronte a voi. \n3. Mentre si suona, collocare il pollice sinistro sugli octave roller sul retro e collocare \nil pollice destro a livello della piastra di terra  posta tra le piastre di bend del pitch. \nCi\u00f2 garantir\u00e0 la massima conduttivit\u00e0 e le migliori prestazioni dello strumento.  Importante: scaricare la guida \nper l'uso  completa per l'EWI5000 \ne il software EWI5000 editor da: \nakaipro.com/ewi5000  \n \n25  \n3. Collegamento \n \nImportante:  gli esempi seguenti non si escludono a vicenda. L'EWI5000 invia audio dalla sua Uscita Line , \ndal jack Cuffie  e senza fili al ricevitore (se \u00e8 collegato) il tutto allo stesso tempo . Si pu\u00f2, ad esempio, \nsuonare l'audio dell'EWI5000 senza fili ascoltando cont emporaneamente tramite le cuffie. Un'eccezione si \nha quando l'EWI5000 \u00e8 collegato al computer e viene sp ento (il quarto scenario in questa sezione); invier\u00e0 \nmessaggi MIDI al computer, ma non invier\u00e0 audio. \n \nLINE OUT PAIRED/POWER L R\n Per suonare l'audio dell'EWI5000 senza fili:\n1. Servirsi del cavo USB in dotazione per collegare il ricevitore \nwireless al computer (acceso). Alternativamente, collegare il ricevitore all'adattatore di alimentazione USB in dotazione e \ncollegare l'adattatore a una presa elettrica. Il LED di \naccoppiamento (Pair)  del ricevitore lampeggia. \n2. Premere il tasto Power per accenderlo. Il LED Preset  vicino \nal tasto Bank lampeggia. \n3. Impostare l' interruttore Wireless  dell'EWI5000 su \" On\".\nQuesto si accoppia automaticamente al ricevitore wireless. \nQuando accoppiato, il LED Pair (di accoppiamento) del \nricevitore e il LED Preset o User  dell'EWI5000 si illuminano in \nmaniera fissa. Il ricevitore wireless invier\u00e0 ora l'audio \ndell'EWI5000 al computer. (le uscite di linea Line del ricevitore wireless non suoneranno il segnale dal computer.) \nNota bene:  se viene perso il collegamento, \u00e8 possibile \ncollegare manualmente l'EWI5000 al ricevitore premendo il \ntasto Pair  del ricevitore e premendo il tasto Power\ndell'EWI5000 una volta. \n \n Per riprodurre l'audio dell'EWI5000 tramite un amplificatore \nesterno, un'interfaccia audio, ecc.: \n1. Servirsi di un cavo standard da 1/4\" (6,35mm) per collegare \nl'uscita Line  dell'EWI5000 all'ingresso di linea \ndell'amplificatore a tastiera, interfaccia audio, ecc. input of \nyour keyboard amplifier, audio interface, etc. \nImportante: l'uscita Line  \u00e8 un'uscita stereo. Se si sta \neffettuando il collegamento a un ingresso mono (come quelli \npresenti sulla maggior parte degli amplificatori a tastiera, \ninterfacce audio, ecc.), servirsi di un cavo TS al posto di un \ncavo TRS. \n2. Premere il tasto Power dell'EWI5000 per accenderlo. \n3. Impostare l' interruttore Wireless  dell'EWI5000 su \" Off\".  \n \n \n \n Per riprodurre l'audio dell'EWI5000 tramite le cuffie: \n1. Collegare cuffie standard da 1/8\" (3,5mm) stereo al jack \ncuffie dell'EWI5000. \n2. Premere il tasto Power dell'EWI5000 per accenderlo. \n3. Impostare l' interruttore Wireless  dell'EWI5000 su \" Off\".  \n o \no \n \n26  \n Per suonare l'EWI5000 come co ntroller MIDI \"cablato\": \n1. Assicurarsi che l'EWI5000 sia spento ( off). Se non lo \n\u00e8, tenere premuto il tasto Power  per un intero \nsecondo. \n2. Servirsi del cavo USB in dotazione per collegare la \nporta USB dell'EWI5000 al computer. \n3. Assicurarsi che l' interruttore Wireless  dell'EWI5000 \nsia su Off.  \n \n \n4. Pronti a suonare! \n \nReggere delicatamente il bocchino tra le labbra con i denti ed espirare in modo che l\u2019aria passi \nattraverso entrambi i la ti della bocca. L\u2019EWI5000 percepisce questa pressione dell\u2019aria tramite \nil sensore del respiro ed esprime il cambiamento sotto forma di volume sonoro e colore, a \nseconda di come si soffia. (L'attivazione dello strumento non deve richiedere troppo fiato.) \nSuggerimenti: \n\u2022 Il bocchino contiene un sensor e del morso. Si pu\u00f2 produrre un effetto vibrato mordendo \ndelicatamente il bocchino: ad ogni morso, si effettuer\u00e0 il bend del pitch. Non mordere \ntroppo forte. \n\u2022 Si possono creare piccoli soffi d\u2019aria utilizzando la lingua per un controllo espressivo \nancora maggiore. \n\u2022 Se i tasti nota, gli octave roller, le piastre di bend del pitch o le piastre di scorrimento \ndell'EWI5000 non sono molto reattive, pu\u00f2 esse re dovuto al fatto che si sta suonando \ncon le mani secche (l'EWI50 00 funziona utilizzando la capacitanza del corpo). Se ci\u00f2 \naccade, servirsi di una leggera quantit\u00e0 di lozione non unta per le mani per migliorare il \ncontatto tra le mani e i tasti. \n \nTasti nota: i tasti nota sono sensori che permettono di produrre suoni co n un leggero tocco. \nL'EWI5000 presenta pi\u00f9 opzioni di fingering, qu indi pu\u00f2 risultare familiare a sassofonisti, \nflautisti, ecc. \u00c8 possibile regolare la posizione dei tre tasti inferiori allentando le viti che \nmantengono ciascuno di essi in posizione.  \nOctave Roller: collocare il pollice sinistro tra due octave roller \nqualsiasi (e sulla piastra di messa a terra) a livello del pannello \nposteriore dell'EWI5000. Far scorrere il pollice verso l'alto o verso il basso lungo gli octave roller per far scorrere la gamma delle \nottave verso l'alto o verso il basso. Mentre si suona, mantenere il \npollice sinistro in contatto con gli octave roller. La posizione tra i \ndue octave roller zigrinati indica il pitch standard.  \nPiastra glide (di scorrimento):  quando si suona una nota, \nspostare il pollice tra gli octave roller (senza farli rotolare) toccando la piastra di  scorrimento sul lato destro per creare un \neffetto di \"scorrimento\". Questo far\u00e0 scorrere in maniera fluida e continua il pitch verso l'alto o verso il basso: una tecnica nota \ncome portamento . \nPiastre di bend del pitch: toccando con il pollice una di queste \npiastre, si pu\u00f2 alzare o abbassare il pitch della nota che si sta \nsuonando. Toccare la piastra superiore per effettuare un bend del \npitch verso l'alto o la piastra in feriore per effettuare un bend del \npitch verso il basso.

Das sind Sensoren, die \nden K\u00f6rper des Spielers f\u00fcr die Erdung nutzen. \n\u2022 Halten Sie das Mundst\u00fcck vor, w\u00e4hrend und nach der Verwen dung des EWI5000 stets sauber. Sie \nk\u00f6nnen seine Au\u00dfenfl\u00e4che mit einem leicht feuchten Tuch reinigen. \n \n1. Stromversorgung des EWI5000 \n \nDas EWI5000 wird von einem Akku mit Strom versorgt . Bitte beachten Sie folgendes zur Verwendung:  \n\u2022 Montage:  Verwenden Sie einen handels\u00fcblichen Kreuzschlitzschraubendreher (nicht im Lieferumfang \nenthalten), um die Batteriefachabdeckung des EWI5000 unterhalb des Kopfh\u00f6rerausgangs  zu \nentfernen, legen die Batterie ein und schlie\u00dfen die Abdeckung wieder. \n\u2022 Aufladen:  Verwenden Sie das mitgelieferte USB-Kabe l, um den USB-Port des EWI5000 entweder (A) \nmit dem mitgelieferten USB-Netzteil mit einer Stromquelle zu verbinden oder (B)  mit einem freien \nUSB-Anschluss Ihres (eingeschalteten) Computers. Sie k\u00f6nnen den Akku aufladen, w\u00e4hrend Sie das EWI5000 verwenden. \n\u2022 Akkulaufzeit:  \u00dcberpr\u00fcfen Sie die Akkulaufzeit, indem Sie die Pegeltaste und die FX-Taste  gedr\u00fcckt \nhalten. Die Akkulaufzeit ( 00-99) wird am Display angezeigt. \n\u2022 Warnung bei niedrigem Ladestand:  Wenn der Akku schwach ist, blinkt die Preset-LED  oder die \nBenutzer-LED , um anzuzeigen, dass Sie den Akku aufladen m\u00fcssen. \n\u2022 Automatisches Abschalten:  Wenn das EWI5000 ca. 10 Minuten  lang keine Aktivit\u00e4t erkennt, schaltet \nes sich automatisch aus. Im Allgemeinen sollten  Sie das EWI5000 jedoch abschalten, wenn Sie es \nnicht verwenden, um den Akku zu schonen. \n \n2. Halten des EWI5000 \n \n1. Befestigen Sie den Tragegurt an der daf\u00fcr vorgesehenen Schlaufe am \nEWI5000. \n2. Legen Sie den Tragegurt um den Hals und halten Sie das EWI5000 wie ein \nSaxophon oder eine Klarinette, also vertikal direkt vor Ihrem K\u00f6rper. \n3. Bei der Wiedergabe, legen Sie Ihren link en Daumen auf die Oktavenrollen an \nder R\u00fcckseite und den rechten Daumen auf die Erdungsplatte zwischen den \nPitch-Bend-Platten. Dadurch wird di e optimale Leitf\u00e4higkeit und beste \nPerformance des Ger\u00e4tes erzielt.  Wichtig: Laden Sie das komplette \nEWI5000- Benutzerhandbuch und die \nEWI5000-Bearbeitungssoftware von \nakaipro.com/ewi5000 herunter. \n \n32  \n3. Anschlie\u00dfen \n \nWichtig:  Die folgenden Szenarien schlie\u00dfen sich nicht gegenseitig aus. Das EW I5000 sendet Audio \u00fcber \nsein Line Out , \u00fcber die Kopfh\u00f6rerbuchse  und drahtlos an den Empf\u00e4nge r (wenn er gekoppelt wurde) - und \nzwar alles gleichzeitig. Sie k\u00f6nnen beispielsweise Ihr EWI5000 \u00fcber Funk spielen und dabei gleichzeitig \u00fcber \ndie Kopfh\u00f6rer mith\u00f6ren. Es gilt jedoch folgen de Ausnahme: Wenn Ihr EWI5000 an den Computer \nangeschlossen und ausgeschaltet ist (das vierte Szenario  in diesem Abschnitt) wird es MIDI-Nachrichten an \nIhren Computer senden, aber keine Audiosignale senden. \n \nLINE OUT PAIRED/POWER L R\n Um EWI5000-Audio drahtlos abzuspielen, gehen Sie wie folgt vor: \n1. Verwenden Sie das mitgelieferte USB-Kabel, um den Funkempf\u00e4nger mit dem (eingeschalteten) Computer zu verbinden. Wahlweise k\u00f6nnen Sie auch den Empf\u00e4nger an das mitgelieferte USB-Netzteil anschlie\u00dfen und das Netzteil in eine \nSteckdose stecken. Die Koppel-LED  des Empf\u00e4ngers wird zu \nblinken beginnen. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie den Ein-/Ausschalter  des EWI5000, um es \neinzuschalten. Die Preset -LED neben der Bank-Taste blinkt. \n3. Stellen Sie den Funkschalter  des EWI5000 auf Ein. Es wird \nautomatisch eine Verbindung zum Funkempf\u00e4nger hergestellt. Nachdem die Verbindung hergestellt wurde, werden die Koppel-\nLED des Empf\u00e4ngers und die Preset-LED  oder Benutzer-LED\ndes EWI5000 durchgehend leuchten. Der Funkempf\u00e4nger wird \nnun die Audiosignale des EWI5000 an Ihren Computer senden. (Die Line-Ausg\u00e4nge des Funk-Empf\u00e4ngers spielen nicht das Signal von Ihrem Computer.) \nHinweis:  Wenn die Verbindung unterbrochen wird, k\u00f6nnen Sie \ndas EWI5000 manuell an den Empf\u00e4nger koppeln, indem Sie die \nKoppeltaste  des Empf\u00e4ngers dr\u00fccken und dann den Ein-\n/Ausschalter  des EWI5000 einmal dr\u00fccken. \n \n Um die Audiosignale des EWI5000 \u00fcber einen externen \nLautsprecher, eine Audio-Schnittstelle etc. abzuspielen, gehen Sie folgenderma\u00dfen vor: \n1. \nVerwenden Sie ein handels\u00fcbliches 1/4\" (6,35 mm) Kabel, um \ndas Line Out  des EWI5000 mit dem Line-Level-Eingang Ihres \nKeyboard-Verst\u00e4rkers, Audio-Schnittstelle etc. zu verbinden. \nWichtig: Die Line Out  ist ein Stereoausgang. Wenn Sie eine \nVerbindung zu einem Mono-Einga ng herstellen (so wie auf den \nmeisten Keyboard-Verst\u00e4rkern, Audio-Schnittstellen etc.), \nverwenden Sie ein TS-Kabel anstelle eines TRS-Kabels. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie den Ein-/Ausschalter  des EWI5000, um es\neinzuschalten. \n3. Stellen Sie den Funkschalter  des EWI5000 auf Aus.  \n \n \n Um die Audiosignale des EWI5000 \u00fcber die Kopfh\u00f6rer \nabzuspielen, gehen Sie folgenderma\u00dfen vor: \n1. Verbinden Sie handels\u00fcbliche 1/8\" (3,5 mm) Stereokopfh\u00f6rer mit \nder Kopfh\u00f6rerbuchse  des EWI5000. \n2. Dr\u00fccken Sie den Ein-/Ausschalter  des EWI5000, um es \neinzuschalten. \n3. Stellen Sie den Funkschalter  des EWI5000 auf Aus.  oder \noder \n \n33  \n Um EWI5000 als \"verdrahteten\" MIDI-Controller zu spielen, \ngehen Sie folgenderma\u00dfen vor: \n1. Sorgen Sie daf\u00fcr, dass das EWI5000 ausgeschaltet ist. \nWenn es nicht ausgeschalte t ist, halten Sie den Ein-\n/Ausschalter  eine volle Sekunde lang gedr\u00fcckt. \n2. Schlie\u00dfen Sie das EWI5000 mit dem mitgelieferten USB-\nKabel an den USB-Port Ihres Computers an. \n3. Stellen Sie sicher, dass der Funkschalter des EWI5000 \nauf Aus steht.  \n \n \n \n4. Spielen Sie! \n \nHalten Sie das Mundst\u00fcck locker zwischen den Li ppen und Z\u00e4hnen und atmen Sie, sodass Ihr Atem \n\u00fcber die Mundwinkel entw eicht. Das EWI5000 erke nnt diesen Anblasluftst rom mit dem Atem-Sensor \nund ver\u00e4ndert Lautst\u00e4rke und Charakter je nachdem, wie Sie in das Instrument blasen. (Es sollte kein \ngro\u00dfer Anblasdruck notwendig sein , um das Ger\u00e4t zu aktivieren.) \nTipps: \n\u2022 Im Mundst\u00fcck befindet sich ein Biss-Sensor. Si e k\u00f6nnen einen Vibrato-Effekt erzielen, indem \nSie leicht auf das Mundst\u00fcck bei\u00dfen, was die Tonh\u00f6he bei jedem Biss ver\u00e4ndert. Bei\u00dfen Sie \njedoch nicht zu heft ig auf das Mundst\u00fcck. \n\u2022 Sie k\u00f6nnen kleine Luftst\u00f6\u00dfe durch das Mundst\u00fcck pressen, indem Sie mit der Zungentechnik \nnoch mehr Ausdrucksm\u00f6glichkeiten schaffen.  \n\u2022 Sollten die Notentasten, Oktavenrollen, Pitch-Bend-Platten oder Gleitplatten des EWI5000 nicht \ngut ansprechen, kann dies daran liegen, dass Ihre  H\u00e4nde zu trocken sind (das EWI5000 arbeitet \nmit k\u00f6rpereigener Spannung). Wenn dies geschieht, k\u00f6nnen Sie eine sehr kleine Menge nicht-\nfettender Handcreme verwenden , um die Verbindung zwisch en H\u00e4nden und Tasten zu \nverbessern. \n \nNoten-Tasten: Die Noten-Tasten sind Sensoren, mit denen Sie T\u00f6ne mit nur einer leichten \nBer\u00fchrung produzieren k\u00f6nnen. Das EWI5000 hat mehrere Fingersatz-Optionen, Saxophonisten und \nFl\u00f6tisten k\u00f6nnte dies bekannt vorkommen. Sie k\u00f6 nnen die Position der drei untersten Tasten \nanpassen, indem Sie die Schrauben l\u00f6sen, die die Tasten fixieren.  \nOktavenrollen: Legen Sie den linken Da umen zwischen zwei \nbeliebige Oktavenrollen (und auf di e Erdungsplatte) auf der R\u00fcckseite \ndes EWI5000. Lassen Si e den Daumen nach oben  oder unten \u00fcber die \nOktavenrollen gleiten, um den Oktave nbereich nach oben oder unten \nzu verschieben. Acht en Sie beim Spielen darauf, dass Ihr linker \nDaumen mit den Oktavenrollen im  Kontakt bleibt. Die Position \nzwischen den zwei geriffelten Oktavenrollen repr\u00e4sentiert die \nStandard-Tonh\u00f6he.  Gleitplatten:  Lassen Sie Ihren Daumen \u00fc ber die Oktavenrollen gleiten \n(ohne sie zu rollen), w\u00e4hrend Sie die Gleitplatte auf ihrer rechten Seite \nber\u00fchren, um einen \"Gleiteffekt\" zu  erzeugen. Dies verschiebt die \nTonh\u00f6he gleichm\u00e4\u00dfig und kontinuierlich nach oben oder unten - eine \nTechnik, die Portamento  genannt wird. \nPitch-Bend-Platten: Ber\u00fchren Sie eine dieser Platten mit dem \nDaumen, um die Tonh\u00f6he der Note, di e Sie spielen, nach oben oder \nunten zu verschieben.

Please note the follo wing about using it:  \n\u2022 Installation:  Use a standard Phillips-head screwdriver (not included) to remove the \nEWI5000's battery compar tment cover below the Phones  output, install the battery, and \nre-secure the cover. \n\u2022 Charging:  Use the included USB cable to conn ect the EWI5000's USB port to either (A) \nthe included USB power adapter, connected to a power source or (B) an available USB \nport on your computer (powered on). You can charge the battery while using the EWI5000. While charging, a dot will flash in the EWI5000's display. \n\u2022 Battery life:  Check the battery life by pressing and holding the Level Button  and then \npressing and holding the FX Button . The amount of battery life ( 00\u201399) will appear in the \ndisplay. \n\u2022 Low-battery warning:  When the battery power is low, the Preset LED  or User LED  will \nblink to indicate that you should charge the battery. \n\u2022 Auto-power-off:  If the EWI5000 detects no activity for approximately 10 minutes , it will \npower off automatically. In general, though, po wer off the EWI5000 to preserve its battery \nlife when you are not using it. \n  \n2. Hold the EWI5000 Properly \n 1. Secure the neck strap to th e EWI5000's neck strap mount. \n2. Place the strap around your ne ck and hold the EWI5000 in the \nsame way you would hold a saxophone or clarinet, with the \ninstrument vertically right in front of you. \n3. When playing, place your left thumb on the octave rollers in the \nback, and place your right thumb on the grounding plate \nbetween the pitch-bend plates. This will ensure the best possible \nconductivity and performance of the instrument.  \n \n6  \n3. Connect \n \nImportant:  The scenarios below are not mutually exclusive. The EWI5000 sends out audio \nfrom its Line Out , from its Phones  jack, and wirelessly to the receiver (if it is paired) all at the \nsame time . You can, for example, play EWI5000's audio wirelessly while also listening through \nthe headphones. \nThe exception is when the EWI5000 is connected to your computer and being used as a MIDI \ncontroller (the fourth scenario in this section): it will send MIDI messages to your computer but \nnot send any audio. You can enable or disable audio in this scenario by pressing and holding \nthe Power Button  until the Preset LED  or User LED  lights solid (audio is enabled) or flashes \n(audio is disabled). \n \n \nLINE OUT PAIRED/POWER L R\n To play EWI5000's audio wirelessly:\n1. Use the included USB cable to connect the wireless \nreceiver to your computer (powered on). Alternatively, connect the receiver to the included USB power \nadapter, and connect the adapter to a power outlet. \nThe receiver's Pair LED  will flash. \n2. Press the EWI5000's Power Button  t o  p o w e r  i t  o n .  \nThe Preset  LED next to its Bank Button will flash. \n3. Set the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  to On. It will \nautomatically \"pair\" to the wireless receiver. When \npaired, the receiver's Pair LED  and the EWI5000's \nPreset LED  or User LED  will light solid. The wireless \nreceiver will now send the EWI5000's audio to your \ncomputer. (The wireless recei ver's Line Outs will not \nplay the signal from your computer.) \nNote:  If the connection is lost, you can manually pair \nthe EWI5000 to the receiver by  pressing the receiver's \nPair Button  and then pressing the EWI5000's Power \nButton  once. \n \n \n To play EWI5000's audio through an external amplifier, \naudio interface, etc.: \n1. Use a standard 1/4\" (6.35mm) cable to connect the \nEWI5000's Line Out  to the line-level input of your \nkeyboard amplifier, audio interface, etc. \nImportant: The Line Out  is a stereo output. If you are \nconnecting to a mono input (like those on most \nkeyboard amplifiers, audio interfaces, etc.), use a TS \ncable instead of a TRS cable. \n2. Press the EWI5000's Power Button  to power it on. \n3. Set the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  to Off.  \n or or \n \n7  \n To play EWI5000's audio through headphones: \n1.

Set the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  to Off.  \n \n \n \n To play EWI5000 as a \"wired\" MIDI controller: \n1. Make sure EWI5000 is powered off. If it is not, press \nand hold the Power Button  for a full second. \n2. Use the included USB cable to connect the \nEWI5000's USB port to your computer. \n3. Make sure the EWI5000's Wireless Switch  is set to \nOff.  \nImportant:  In this mode, by default, the EWI5000 will \nnot send out any audio signal. You can enable or \ndisable audio by pre ssing and holding the Power \nButton  until the Preset LED  or User LED  lights solid \n(audio is enabled) or flashes (audio is disabled). \n \n \n \n8  \n4. Play! \n \nHold the mouthpiece gently between your lips with your teeth, and exhale so your breath \npasses through both sides of your mouth. The EWI5000 detects this wind pressure with the \nbreath sensor and expresses the change in sound volume and character, depending on how \nyou blow. (It should not take much br eath to activate the instrument.) \nTips: \n\u2022 There is a bite sensor in the mouthpiece. You can produce a vibrato effect by gently \nbiting the mouthpiece, which will bend the pi tch up each time you bite, but do not bite \ntoo hard. \n\u2022 You can create small bursts of air by tonguing the mouthpiece for even more expressive \ncontrol. \n\u2022 If the EWI5000's note keys, octave rollers, pitch-bend plates, or glide plates are not very \nresponsive, it could be  because you are playing with dr y hands (the EWI5000 works by \nusing the body's capacitance). If this happen s, you can use a very small amount of non-\ngreasy hand lotion to improve the connection between your hands and the keys. \n \nNote Keys: The note keys are sensors that let you produce \nsound with only a light touch. The EWI5000 has multiple fingering \noptions, so it can feel familiar to saxophonists, flutists, etc. You can adjust the position of the th ree lowest keys by loosening the \nscrews that hold each of them in place.  \nTo learn how to adjust the note keys' response, please see \nAdvanced Functions > Adjusting Sensors > Note Delay (Note \nKeys) . \n \nOctave Rollers: Place your left thumb between any two octave \nrollers (and over th e grounding plate) on the EWI5000's back \npanel. Slide your thumb up or do wn across the octave rollers to \nshift its octave range up or down. While playing, keep your left \nthumb in contact with the octave  rollers. The position between \nthe two knurled octave rollers indicates the standard pitch.  \n \nGlide Plate:  While playing a note, move  your thumb across the \noctave rollers (without rolling them) while touching the glide plate \non their right side to create a \"glide\" effect. This will smoothly and \ncontinuously slide the pitch up or down\u2014a technique known as \nportamento . \nTo learn how to adjust the glide plate's response, please see \nAdvanced Functions > Adjusting Sensors > Glide Plate . \n \nPitch-Bend Plates: Touch your thumb to either of these plates to \nmove the pitch of the note you are playing up or down. Touch the \nupper plate to bend the pitch upwa rd or the lower plate to bend \nthe pitch downward. Before you get accustomed to using these \nplates, you may produce unexpected sounds by touching them \naccidentally. You can adjust the position of each plate by \nloosening its screw. \nTo learn how to adjust the pitch- bend plates' response, please \nsee Advanced Functions > Adjusting Sensors > Pitch-Bend \nPlates .

This connection will power the EWI5000 and charge its battery as well as \nsend MIDI messages to your computer. \n \n12  \nAdvanced Functions \n \nThe EWI5000 is a woodwind-instrum ent-type MIDI controller with  an internal sound module \nand built-in effects. It allows you to perform with  the articulation of an acoustic instrument but \nalso with the character of an electronic instrument with a wide variety of sounds and tonal \ncolorings. \nThe EWI5000 has two modes: Performance Mode  and Setup Mode . When you turn the \nEWI5000 on, it will be in Performance Mode. Press the Setup Button  to enter Setup Mode \nwhere you can adjust the sensors' sensitivity or MIDI settings. To return to Performance Mode, \npress the Setup Button  until the display is blank. \nThe EWI5000 is a musical instrument much like other acoustic instrument s, so the more you \npractice, the better you'll play. You may find it challenging at first, but as you find and develop \nyour own playing style, we think you'll find it has unlimited possibilities\u2014there are no hard and \nfast rules. \nFor reference, you can see an overview of the entire menu structure of Setup Mode in \nAppendix > Menu Structure > Setup Mode . \n \n \nAdjusting Sound Parameters \n \nImportant: You can adjust the sound parameter knobs from either Performance Mode or \nSetup Mode at any time. \nYou can adjust the EWI5000's sounds to your preference by using (1) the \nincluded sound editor software and/or (2) EWI5000's eight parameter \nknobs (remove the cover above the display to expose the knobs). \nThe eight parameter knobs control some of the basic characteristics of \neither  the Program or the EWI5000 it self, as described below. \nEach Parameter Knob, except for Fine, has a primary and secondary function: \nAccess the primary function by simply turning the knob. \nAccess the secondary function by pressing and holding the Trans Button  and then turning the \nknob. \n \nFilter  Primary: sets the Program's filter cutoff frequency. \nSecondary:  sets the Program's filter resonance. \nBreath  Primary: sets the EWI5000's breath sensor offset (how much \nbreath is required to play a sound). \nSecondary:  sets the EWI5000's breath sensor's gain (how \nloudly or quietly you can play; a higher setting decreases the \ndynamic range). \nBite Primary: sets the EWI5000's bite sensitivity (how much biting the mouthpiece affects the sound). \nSecondary:  sets the amount of Delay  effect applied to the \nProgram. \nSemi Primary:  sets the EWI5000's tuning by semitones (half-steps). \nSecondary:  sets the rate of the Delay  effect applied to the \nProgram.  \n\uf0c6 \nFILTER\nBITE SEMI\nFINE REVERB\nCHORUS LFOBREATH\n \n13  \nFine Primary: sets the EWI5000's tuning by fractions of a \nsemitone. \nSecondary:  no function.  \nReverb Primary: sets the amount of Reverb  effect applied to the \nProgram. \nSecondary:  sets the room size of the Reverb  effect applied to \nthe Program.  \nChorus  Primary: sets the amount of Chorus  effect applied to the \nProgram. Secondary:  sets the depth of the Chorus  effect applied to the \nProgram. \nLFO Primary: sets the amount of modulation ( CC#1 ) applied to the \nProgram. Secondary:  sets the frequency of the modulation's low-\nfrequency oscillator for the Program.  \n \n \nIf you like the adjustments you have made and want to save them to the Program, press the \nSave Button. \nImportant:  When saving, only the settings that apply to the Program will be saved. Settings \nthat apply to the EWI5000 will affect all Programs  because they affect the sensors and tuning \nof the EWI5000 hardware itself. \nTip: To further customize your sound, use the EWI5000 sound editor software to adjust even \nmore Program parameters, and use the parameters knobs' additional functions to adjust the \nEWI5000's sensors.

FILTER\nBITE SEMI\nFINE REVERB\nCHORUS LFOBREATH\n \n14  \nAdjusting Sensors \n \nThe EWI5000 has been given opti mal default settings, but we recommend adjusting them to \nyour preference to get the most out of your performance. You can customize these settings in \nSetup Mode.  \nTo enter Setup Mode,  press the Setup Button . The display will indicate the current setting. \nThough adjusting the settings may seem compli cated, you won't need to it every time you \nperform. The values you set are essential to the EWI5000's functionality, and your \nperformance will be much more expressive and precise when the settings match your playing \nstyle. Once you adjust everything to your pref erence, you won't need to adjust anything much \nfurther. \nYou can adjust the following sensors. Click one of them to skip to that part of the chapter. \nNote Delay (Note Keys)  Pitch-Bend Plates  \nBreath Sensor   Glide Plate  \nBite Sensor \n \nWe also recommend seeing the Calibrating Sensors  chapter. Calibrating  the sensors ensures \ntheir sensitivity and response fits your performance style the best. \nFor reference, you can see an overview of the entire menu structure of Setup Mode in \nAppendix > Menu Structure > Setup Mode . \n \n \nNote Delay (Note Keys) \n The Note Delay function adjusts the response of the note keys. The EWI5000's note key \nresponse is preset to accommo date rapid changes in fingerin gs, but you may occasionally \nproduce unexpected sounds, depending on your playing style. In this case, you may find that you can play more smoothly by adjusting the Note Delay. \n \nTo adjust the Note Delay: \n1. Press and hold the Setup Button  to enter Setup Mode.  \n2. Press the Hold Button or Interval Button  to scroll through the options until dL (Note \nDelay)  appears in the display. \n3. Release the Setup Button .

To return to Performance Mode, press the Setup Button  until the display is blank. \n \n \n \n \n \n19  \nPitch-Bend Plates \n \nWhen you touch either of the pitch-bend plates , the EWI5000 will bend the pitch of the note \nyou are playing, allowing you to be more expressive with your performance. Alternatively, you \ncan set the pitch-bend plates to send messa ges for other individu al MIDI Continuous \nControllers (CCs). \nImportant:  The overall change in pitch varies by how much of the plate your thumb is \ntouching as well how it is touching the plate. Experiment  with these setti ngs for the best \nresults.  \n \nTo adjust the pitch-bend plates: \n1. Press and hold the Setup Button  to enter Setup Mode.  \n2. Press the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to scroll through the options until PU (Pitch-\nBend Up Plate)  or Pd (Pitch-Bend Down Plate)  appears in the display.  \n3. Release the Setup Button . The display will show the current mode. Use the Hold Button  \nor Interval Button  to select any of the following options: \n\u2022 Pb (Pitch Bend):  Touching the pitch-bend plate wi ll bend the pitch of the note. \nPress the Trans Button  to turn it on or off. When it is on, a dot will appear in the \ndisplay.  \nTo set the depth of the pitch bend, press and hold the Trans  Button , and then use \nthe Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the value: -63 to +63 (values under -9 will \nbe shown with a dot between the digits). Ne gative values indica te a downward pitch \nbend, while positive values in dicate an upward pitch bend. \n\u2022 CC (Continuous Controller):  Touching the pitch-bend plate will send a MIDI \nContinuous Controller (CC) message.  If you select this, press the Trans  Button  to \nset additional message parameters: \no En (Enable):  This determines whether CC output  is enabled or disabled. If you \nselect this, press and hold the Trans Button , and press the Hold Button  or \nInterval Button  to turn it on ( On) or off ( OF). When it is on, a dot will appear in \nthe display. \no Cn (Controller Number):  This is the CC number th at will be sent when you \ntouch the pitch-bend plate. Use the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the \nCC number ( 01\u2013127; values over 99 will be shown as the last two digits with a \ndot between them). Match this number to the CC number of the parameter you \nwant to control. \nImportant:  We recommend setting En to off ( OF) before changing this \nparameter to prevent accidentally muting  the EWI5000's output while moving \nthrough CC #7  (Volume). \no dU (Data-Up):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you are \nnot touching the pitch-bend plate. Press and hold the Trans Button , and then \nuse the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the value ( 00\u2013127; values over \n99 will be shown as the last two digits with a dot between them). \no dP (Data-Press):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you \ntouch the pitch-bend plate. Use the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the \nvalue ( 00\u2013127; values over 99 will be shown as the last two digits with a dot \nbetween them). \n4. To return to Performance Mode, press the Setup Button  until the display is blank. \n \n \n20  \nGlide Plate \n \nThe EWI5000's glide plate lets you use a glide effect called portamento  to move between \nnotes for greater expressiveness in your performance. Alternatively, you can set the glide plate \nto send messages for other individual  MIDI Continuous Controllers (CCs). \nImportant:  \nMake sure PS is on if you want to use the portamento effect. The EWI5000's synth needs this \nsetting to be enabled in order for portamento to work properly. \nSome sound modules may not handle portamento  messages well, which could generate some \nundesirable sounds. If this  is the case, make sure PS is off. \n To set the function of the glide plate: \n1. Press and hold the Setup Button  to enter Setup Mode.  \n2. Press the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to scroll through the options until GL (Glide \nPlate)  appears in the display.  \n3. Release the Setup Button . The display will show the current mode. Use the Hold Button  \nor Interval Button  to select any of the following options: \n\u2022 Pt (Portamento Time):  The glide plate will send its messages using CC #5 , which is \nportamento time. If you select this, press the Trans Button  to set additional \nparameters: \no En (Enable):  This determines whether CC #5  output is enabled or disabled. If \nyou select this, press and hold the Trans Button , and press the Hold Button  \nor Interval Button  to turn it on ( On) or off ( OF). When it is on, a dot will appear \nin the display. \no dU (Data-Up):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you are \nnot touching the glide plate. Press and hold the Trans Button , and then use \nthe Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the value ( 00\u2013127; values over 99 will \nbe shown as the last two digi ts with a dot between them). \no dP (Data-Press):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you \ntouch the glide plate. Press and hold the Trans Button , and then use the Hold \nButton  or Interval Button  to set the value ( 00\u2013127; values over 99 will be \nshown as the last two digits  with a dot between them). \nImportant:  Make sure PS is on if you want to use the portamento effect. The \nEWI5000's synth needs this setting to be en abled in order for portamento to work \nproperly. \n\u2022 PS (Portamento Switch):  The glide plate will send its messages using CC #65 . \nPress the Trans Button  to turn it on or off. When it is on, a dot will appear in the \ndisplay. \nImportant:  Turn this on if you want to use the portamento effect. The EWI5000's \nsynth needs this setting to be enabled in  order for portamento to work properly. \n\uf0c6 \n \n21  \n\u2022 Lt (Legato Time):  The glide plate will send its messages using CC #104 , which the \nEWI5000 uses for Legato Time. This is the time during which a note ends as a new \nnote begins. Shorter times will result in more abrupt changes between notes, while \nlonger times will result in more fluid changes that sound almost slurred. (This is \ndifferent from portamento , though, as Legato Time does  not shift the pitch of any \nnotes.) \nIf you select this, press the Trans Button  to set addition al parameters: \no En (Enable):  This determines whether CC #104  output is enabled or disabled. \nIf you select this, press and hold the Trans Button , and press the Hold Button  \nor Interval Button  to turn it on ( On) or off ( OF). When it is on, a dot will appear \nin the display. \no dU (Data-Up):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you are \nnot touching the glide plate. Press and hold the Trans Button , and then use \nthe Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the value ( 00\u2013127; values over 99 will \nbe shown as the last two digi ts with a dot between them). \no dP (Data-Press):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you \ntouch the glide plate. Press and hold the Trans Button , and then use the Hold \nButton  or Interval Button  to set the value ( 00\u2013127; values over 99 will be \nshown as the last two digits  with a dot between them). \n\u2022 CC (Continuous Controller):  The glide plate will send a MIDI Continuous Controller \n(CC) message. If you select this, press the Trans  Button  to set additional message \nparameters: \no En (Enable):  This determines whether CC output  is enabled or disabled. If you \nselect this, press and hold the Trans Button , and press the Hold Button  or \nInterval Button  to turn it on ( On) or off ( OF). When it is on, a dot will appear in \nthe display. \no Cn (Controller Number):  This is the CC number th at will be sent when you \ntouch the glide plate. Use the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the CC \nnumber ( 01\u2013127; values over 99 will be shown as the last two digits with a dot \nbetween them). Match this number to the CC number of the parameter you \nwant to control. \nImportant:  We recommend setting En to off ( OF) before changing this \nparameter to prevent accidentally muting  the EWI5000's output while moving \nthrough CC #7  (Volume). \no dU (Data-Up):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you are \nnot touching the glide plate. Use the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to set the \nvalue ( 00\u2013127; values over 99 will be shown as the last two digits with a dot \nbetween them). \no dP (Data-Press):  The value that will be sent with the CC message when you \ntouch the glide plate.

Select the Program number you want to assign (using any of the methods described in \nthis chapter, Selecting Programs ). \n3. Touch the Program Button , and press the Setup Button . The Program number will flash \nin the display. \n4. Touch the desired note key and blow into the mouthpiece. The Program is now assigned \nto the note key you were touching. (If you touc h more than one note key during this step, \nthe Program will be assigned to the top-most note key you are touching.) \nNote:  While touching the Program Button , no sound will play if you blow into the mouthpiece. \n \nTo select a Program using the note keys: \n1. Make sure your PC (Program Change)  setting has dP (Direct Program)  enabled. See In \nan External MIDI Sound Module or Software  to learn how to do this. \n2. Make sure you are in the desired bank (Preset or User). If not, press the Bank Button  to \nselect it. \n3. Without touching any note keys, touch the Program Button  (the screw just above the \nPitch-Bend Up Plate ). The current Program will appear in the display. \n4. While still touching the Program Button , touch the note key as signed to the desired \nProgram. (If you touch more than one note key during this step, the Program that is \nselected will be the one assigned to the top-most note key you are touching.) \n5. After the assigned Program number appears in  the display, blow into the mouthpiece. \nThe Program is now selected. \n6. Release the Program Button .  \nNote:  While touching the Program Button , no sound will play if you blow into the mouthpiece. \n \n33  \nIn an External MIDI Sound Module or Software \nYou can use the EWI5000 to send a MIDI Progra m Change message to a connected external \nMIDI sound module or to software on a connected computer. To do this, follow the same \nsteps as described above. When you select a new Program on the EWI 5000, it sends a MIDI \nProgram Change message of the same number to your external sound module. \nIn order to do this properly, conf igure the settings described below. \n \n1. Press and hold the Setup Button  to enter Setup Mode.  \n2. Press the Hold Button  or Interval Button  to scroll through the options until PC \n(Program Change)  appears in the display. \n3. Release the Setup Button . The display will show the current mode. Use the Hold Button  \nor Interval Button  to select any of the following options: \n\u2022 dP (Direct Program):  When this is on, you can touch the Program Button  and then \ntouch a note key assigned to a Program to send the Program Change message. (To \nassign Programs to the note keys, please see Using the Note Keys .) Press the \nTrans Button  to turn it on or off. When it is on, a dot will appear in the display. \n\u2022 Ot (Out):  When this is on, the EWI5000 can send Program Change messages from \nits USB Port  and MIDI Out . When this is off, the EWI5000 will not send any Program \nChange messages externally. Press the Trans Button  to turn it on or off. When it is \non, a dot will appear in the display. \n4. Press the Setup Button  to return to Performance Mode. \n  \nSaving Programs \n \nTo save a Program: 1. Make sure the current Program has all of the settings you want to save. \n2. Press the Save Button . The \"destination\" User Program number will then blink in the \ndisplay. \n3. Use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to select the User Program number you want \nto save to. \n4. Press the Save Button  again to save the Program, or press any other button to cancel \nthe operation. \n  \n \n34  \nUsing Effects (FX) \n \nYou can use the EWI5000's FX Menu to apply and edit three different effects to its audio \noutput: Reverb, Chorus, and Delay. \nImportant:  Your EWI5000's audio output must be enabled to edit its effects. If you are using it \nas a MIDI controller only (its Preset LED  or User LED  is flashing), enable its audio output by \npressing and holding the Power Button  until its Preset LED  or User LED  is lit solid. \nTo enter the FX Menu,  press and hold the FX Button , and then use the Hold Button  and \nInterval Button  to select rb (Reverb) , ch (Chorus) , or dL (Delay) . Release the FX Button  to \nedit that effect's parameters, described below in each section. \nTo exit the FX Menu,  press the FX Button  once. \nLearn more about setting the parameters for the Reverb , Chorus , and Delay  effects in this \nchapter. \n \n \nReverb \n Reverb is a spatial effect, simulating the nuanced reverberation of sound in the space of a \nparticular room. \n \nTo edit the Reverb effect: \n1. Press and hold the FX Button , and then use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to \nselect rb (Reverb) . \n2. Release the FX Button . The effect level will appear in the display. \n3. To set the effect level, use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  (00\u201399). \nTip: You can also set the eff ect level by using EWI5000's Reverb  Parameter Knob . \nTo select another parameter to edit, or press and hold the Trans Button  or Level Button , \nuse the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to select the parameter, and then release the  \nTrans Button  or Level Button : \n\u2022 ut (Wet/Dry):  This determines the blend between the \"wet\" (affected) and \"dry\" \n(unaffected) signal. 00 is all dry, and 99 is all wet, while 50 is approximately an equal \nmix of both. \n\u2022 dP (Damping):  This determines how much higher frequencies are absorbed by the \nsimulated room as the reverbating sound decays over the time. At 00, no high \nfrequencies are absorbed, allowing for their maximum decay time. A setting of 99 \nresults in the most absorption of higher frequencies, creating a warmer sound. \n\u2022 ud (Width):  This determines the width of the stereo image generated by the reverb. \n00 produces the narrowest stereo image, while 99 produces the widest. \n\u2022 rS (Room Size):  This determines the size of the room that the reverb will simulate. \n00 corresponds to a small room size, while 99 corresponds to a large one. \n4. Press the FX Button  once to exit the FX Menu. \n \n \n \n35  \nChorus \n \nThe Chorus effect modulates the pitch and a delay of the input signal, which are then added to \nthe dry signal. In small amounts, this creates the illusion of multiple voices playing at once.  \n \nTo edit the Chorus effect: \n1. Press and hold the FX Button , and then use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to \nselect ch (Chorus) . \n2. Release the FX Button . The effect level will appear in the display. \n3. To set the effect level, use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  (00\u201399). \nTip: You can also set the eff ect level by using EWI5000's Chorus Parameter Knob . \nTo select another parameter to edit, or press and hold the Trans Button  or Level Button , \nuse the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to select the parameter, and then release the  \nTrans Button  or Level Button : \n\u2022 rt (Rate):  This determines the rate of the chorus effect. 00 corresponds to a rate of \n1.0 Hz , while 99 corresponds to a rate of 3.0 Hz . \n\u2022 dP (Depth):  This determines the depth or intensity of the chorus effect. 00 is a \nsubtle depth, while 99 produces a very obvi ously modulated sound. \nTip: To produce more pronounced \"shimmering\" and \"watery\" sounds, set the \nDepth to higher values. \n4. Press the FX Button  once to exit the FX Menu. \n \n \nDelay \n \nThe Delay effect produces an echo of the original signal for a specified period of time. \n \nTo edit the Delay effect: \n1. Press and hold the FX Button , and then use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to \nselect dL (Delay) . \n2. Release the FX Button . The effect level will appear in the display. \n3. To set the effect level, use the Hold Button  and Interval Button  (00\u201399). \nTip: You can also set the effect leve l by pressing and holding EWI5000's Trans Button  \nwhile turning the Bite Parameter Knob . \nTo select another parameter to edit, or press and hold the Trans Button  or Level Button , \nuse the Hold Button  and Interval Button  to select the parameter, and then release the  \nTrans Button  or Level Button : \n\u2022 dt (Time):  This determines the ra te of the delay effect. 00 corresponds to a rate of \n0.1 ms , while 99 corresponds to a rate of 742.9 ms . Each increment is \napproximately 7.5 ms . \n\u2022 Fb (Feedback):  This determines how much of the effect's signal is routed back into \nthe effect again. No signal is fed back into the effect at 00, while 99 produces a lot \nof feedback. Be careful if you set this to high values! \n4. Press the FX Button  once to exit the FX Menu. \n \n36  \nFingering Modes \n \nThe EWI5000 lets you select from  different fingering modes to a ccommodate differ ent styles of \nplaying.   \nTo select a fingering mode:  1. Press and hold the Setup Button  to enter Setup Mode.  \n2. Use the Hold Button or Interval Button to scroll through the options until Fn (Fingering) \nappears in the display.  \n3. Release the Setup Button . The display will show the current mode. Use the Hold Button  \nor Interval Button  to select any of the following options: \n\u2022 EI (Standard EWI): This is the standard fingering for the EWI5000, based on the \nfingering of conventional woodwind instruments. \n\u2022 SA (Saxophone):  This fingering resembles that of a standard saxophone. In this \nmode, the EWI will ignore fingers that are two notes below the highest note. \n\u2022 FL (Flute): This fingering resembles that of a standard C flute, though flutists will have to familiarize themselves with a few new fingerings to properly adapt their \nperformance to the EWI5000. \n\u2022 Ob (Oboe):  This fingering resembles that of a standard oboe, though oboists will \nhave to familiarize themselves with a few new fingerings to properly adapt their \nperformance to the EWI5000. \n\u2022 Eu (Standard EVI*):  EVI stands for electric valve instrument . This fingering may be \nuseful to players who wish to use fingerings closer to those of a brass instrument. \n\u2022 Er (EVI with revers ed octave rollers): This fingering most closely resembles the \nmovement of the left wrist on an actual EVI (recommended mostly for experienced EVI players). \n4. Press the Setup Button  to return to Performance Mode. \n \nPlease refer to Appendix > Fingering Charts  to see the differences between the various \nfingering modes. \nFor reference, you can see an overview of the entire menu structure of Setup Mode in \nAppendix > Menu Structure > Setup Mode . \n \n* Special thanks to Matt Traum of Patchman Music ( patchmanmusic.com ) for the development of EVI fingering. \n \n \n37  \nRestoring Default Settings \n \nTo return all of the EWI5000's se ttings to its factory defaults: \n1. Disconnect the EWI5000 from your computer. \n2. Power off the EWI5000 by pressing and holding the Power Button  for a full second and \nthen releasing it. \n3.

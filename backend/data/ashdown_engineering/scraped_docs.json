A band of frequencies in the mid range of the bass signal is selected and the distortion effect is only applied to those frequencies creating a unique overdrive flavour whereby the top and bottom end remains untouched, but the powerful mids can be tuned from a mild-growl to full-on distortion.\nYou can tune the distortion frequency range to suit your bass/style and a mix control let's you balance the original 'dry' signal back into the mix.\nSetting the level\nWhether you're using an active or passive bass, the Ashdown VU meter in combination with the Input level knob let's you easily find the sweet spot. Ensuring you get the best possible tone in and out of whatever instrument you're using.\nBuilt for the road\nWe know the rigours of the live gigging, that's why we build our pedals tough enough for whatever the road throws at them.

This lets you sculpt unique powerful distorted tones that preserve the core tones you need to fit in the mix. To get the best results we found that different distortion types were needed for the different frequency bands.\nThe Drive control sets the amount of distortion, Distortion Tone adjusts its character and Distortion Level balances the amount of the effect with the clean bass signal.\nSetting the level\nWhether you're using an active or passive bass, the Ashdown VU meter in combination with the Input level knob let's you easily find the sweet spot, ensuring you get the best possible tone in and out - whatever instrument you're using.\nBuilt for the road\nWe know the rigours of the live gigging, that's why we build our pedals tough enough for whatever the road throws at them.

Splitting the signal into high and low frequency bands lets us apply compression independently to each \u2013 fast attack and decay for the high frequency and slow attack and decay for the deep bass. This approach let's you fine tune a powerful, punchy sound to your exact requirements \u2013 increasing sustain, smoothing out dynamics, adding definition or even boosting volume.\nSetting the level\nWhether you're using an active or passive bass, the Ashdown VU meter in combination with the Input level knob let's you easily find the sweet spot, ensuring you get the best possible tone in and out whatever instrument you're using.\nBuilt for the road\nWe know the rigours of the live gigging, that's why we build our pedals tough enough for whatever the road throws at them. Metal casings, premium controls and switches, recessed knobs and kickguards to protect screens and VU meters \u2013 bring it on!\nTrue Bypass Switching\nWe don't mess with your tone.

With dual Neutrik Speakon outputs and a minimum load of 4 ohms, it\u2019s built to handle anything from a single 8-ohm cabinet to a full wall of doom-inducing enclosures. A dedicated slave input allows for multiple heads to be linked together, multiplying your sonic power and cementing its name as the ultimate weapon for bassists who refuse to be ignored.\nUnique Visual Feedback\nDual\nVU\nMonitoring\nA defining feature of the Head of Doom is its twin VU meters - the first Ashdown head to showcase both input and output levels side by side. The input VU meter ensures you always hit the sweet spot for your bass, while the output VU keeps your stage levels under control. Backed by a powerful 9-band EQ and a Shape control, bassists can craft tones ranging from tight and punchy to dark and thunderous, all while keeping precise visual monitoring at their fingertips.\nBuilt for Studio and Stage\nProfessional\nConnectivity\nConnectivity is at the heart of the Head of Doom. It features a tuner out, DI out, transparent FX loop, and line input for integrating samplers or external sources. Output muting silences the DI while keeping the tuner out live, allowing for silent tuning on stage. A pair of Neutrik jack/Speakon sockets ensure flexible cabinet pairing, while three transformer-isolated outputs provide professional-grade options for recording or running multiple rigs.\nSignature Harmonic Distortion\nThe\nDoom\nControl\nThe aptly named Doom control pushes extra current through the amp\u2019s 12AX7 preamp valve, unlocking rich harmonic distortion tailored for bass. From subtle grit to full-blown growl, this feature transforms your tone into a force of nature. Best of all, the Doom control can be pre-set and toggled via footswitch, giving you on-demand access to crushing overdrive that retains low-end power and clarity.\nA Signature Amp for a Bass Icon\nGeezer\nButler\u2019s\nLegacy\nin\nSound\nUser\nmanual\nCLICK THE IMAGE ABOVE TO DOWNLOAD THE USER MANUAL\nFAQs\nPlease read our\nFAQs\npage to find out more.\nHow Long Will My Order Take To Arrive?\nOrders placed before 3pm (Monday-Thursday) are dispatched on the same day.

    "title": "\n                  OriginAL Valve Pre-DI Pedal\n                ",
    "content": "Ashdown Engineering\nOriginAL\nValve\nPre-DI\nPedal\n\u00a3549.00\nValve driven pre-amplifier pedal like no other.\nThe OriginAL beautifully shapes the bass player\u2019s clean signal whilst offering a foot-switchable valve powered overdrive in a single compact unit. Crystal clear cleans and powerful overdriven growl, The OriginAL encompasses it all.\nSetting the Level\nThe -3db Pad switch is used in conjunction with the input level control to suit the instrument in use, Low output basses will not require the use of the Pad but Higher Output basses may overload the pedal and require use of the Pad. Overloading the Input will simply create unwanted distortion and sound unpleasant, with experimentation the correct settings will be found for the Instruments you have.\nReal Valve Overdrive\nThe Valve overdrive circuit fitted into the Original pre amplifier duplicates the kind of overdrive you would get from Valve Amplifier and works in exactly the same way as follows,The DRIVE GAIN controls the magnification of the signal from the instrument, at higher settings the Valve will be overdriven clipping and compressing the sound from the instrument, Higher harmonics and higher frequencies will be accentuated whilst the lower frequencies will be compressed. Just as in a valve amplifier this will be accompanied by a drastic increase in volume dependant entirely on the setting of the gain control.\nTo enable you to match the Overdriven signal level to the clean level a Drive level control is also provided. In this way it is therefore possible to change from a crystal clean sound to an overdriven sound of similar level. The Input Level control also has some bearing on this as it sets the starting point from which the overdrive circuit works so some experimentation with this in conjunction with Drive Gain and Drive Level will be required to get exactly the results you are looking for.\nThe OVERDRIVE is foot switchable and the pedal lights up blue when the overdrive is engaged. When using the footswitch it is advisable and desirable to avoid large increases in volume as sudden level changes may produce switching noise further down the line.\nPower Supply\nThe ORIGINal Pre-amplifier requires a Linear Isolated High quality Regulated power supply that can supply a current 300mA at a voltage of 15-18V DC Centre Pin NEGATIVE for the fitted 2.1mm connector socket.

Unlocking further tonal possibilities, the App-Tek socket allows players to access the ever-growing range of amp sim and effects apps available on Smartphones and devices, including Ashdown\u2019s very own ABM Pre App.\nWireless\nAllowing the bassist to roam at home, B-Social features wireless audio connectivity and a transmitter that lets the bass connect wirelessly to the amp for cable free jamming.\nWireless Bluetooth audio connectivity also enables audio streaming from any compatible music player. Adding a new social dimension to the amp, the B-Social includes a second input so the bassist can play along with another bass player or guitarist - electric or acoustic.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple feature - and obvious - but so often over looked by amp companies,\u201d says Mark Gooday. \u201cBeing able to plug into a single amp with a friend or band mate makes B-Social a great tool for collaborative writing and recording.\u201d\nRecording\nRecording itself is made simple via the built-in USB audio interface, compatible with all major DAWs on both PC and Mac platforms. The unit features a speaker mute switch for headphone monitoring.\nConnectivity\nRounding out the feature set is a Line In, Line Out and a Headphone Out for silent practice.

After four years of the current MAG line we decided they needed a little bit of an update. We didn't by any means look to change the wheel of the hugely successful MAG range but add a little more bang for your buck with the addition of an Overdrive control, this can be easily dialed in on the front of the amp and also foot switched in and out using a standard single latching footswitch. The MAG 300H head features a potent new fan-cooled 600 watts RMS power section. Rotary bass, middle and treble controls are supplemented by smaller rotary controls providing 15dB of cut and boost at 220Hz and 1.6kHz, providing a comprehensive 5 band EQ section. Additionally, front panel push switches for Bright and Deep settings provide instant access to attacking and warm, rounded sounds respectively and, on the subject of low-end response, the trademark Ashdown sub-harmonic generator is ready and able to deliver truck loads of earth moving tone if called upon. Inputs are provided for active and passive instruments and the front panel also features an effects send and return, a tuner/line output and a balanced DI output for direct connection to a mixing console.\nWith the MAGs now achieving EVO III status, the amplifier also includes a built-in compressor with precision sonic control.\nThe cabinet is finished in a tough, retro-style vinyl covering.\nSpecification\nPower Output\n600 Watts\nPower Requirement\n115 - 230V\nSpeaker Outputs\n2 x Jack Sockets\nFrequency Response\n-3dB at 17Hz - 30Khz\nHigh Instrument Input\nImpedance 3.9m Ohms, input range 150mV - 20mV p-p\nLow Instrument Input\nImpedance 10K Ohms, input range 300mV - 40V p-p\nLine Input\nImpedance 10K Ohms, Level 0dBu nominal\nTuner Output\nImpedance 22K Ohms, Level 0dBu nominal\nDI Output\n600 Ohms balanced, level -20dBu nominal\nImpedance\nMinimum 4 Ohm\nEQ\nBass +/-15dB @ 100Hz Lo Mid +/-15dB @ 220Hz Middle +/-15dB @ 660Hz Hi Mid +/-15dB @ 1.6kHz Treble +/-15dB @ 7kHz shelving Deep +\nEffects Send\nImpedance 22k Ohm, level 0dBu nominal\nEffects Return\nImpedance 22K Ohm, level 0dBu nominal\nDistortion\nless than 0.5% THD\nSignal to Noise\nBetter than 80dB (EQ Flat)\nH x W x D (mm)\n90 x 463 x 267\nWeight (kg)\n10\nShare:\nShare on Facebook\nShare on X\nPin on Pinterest\nShare by Email\nShare\nShare\nFacebook\nShare on Facebook\nX (Twitter)\nShare on X\nPinterest\nPin on Pinterest\nE-mail\nShare by Email\nPairs well with\nNeed help?\nIf you have any questions, you are always welcome to contact us.

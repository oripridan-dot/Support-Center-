Here’s what they do, and how to add them to your project.</p><h2 class="">Quick Tips</h2><ul class="list list--unordered text-media-article__list"><li class="list__listitem listitem list__listitem--left">Add tracks to your Cubase project by right clicking in the track list area or by going to Project &gt; Add Track and choosing a track type.</li><li class="list__listitem listitem list__listitem--left">Many tracks let you choose options while adding them like number of tracks, audio routing or which VST instrument to load.</li><li class="list__listitem listitem list__listitem--right">Some track types are used for project management like Folder, Group and Marker tracks.</li><li class="list__listitem listitem list__listitem--right">The Arranger Track is one of Cubase’s most powerful features, letting you create multiple versions of a track without doing any editing.</li></ul><p class="" role="paragraph">Tracks are at the heart of Cubase and are the tools with which you build a project. While the most common types of tracks are audio and MIDI for recording sound and triggering VST instruments, Cubase has several other kinds of track that you can use to expand and manage your productions. These include video, group, effect and arranger tracks to name but a few. In this guide we will look at how to add tracks and what the various track types are used for, as well as how they can help you get more out of Cubase.</p><h2 class="">How To Add Tracks</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">The quickest way to add a new track in Cubase is to control-click or right click in the track list area towards the center left of the main Project window. This reveals a contextual menu that gives you quick access to each track type and selecting one will in many cases open a window that lets you choose the number of tracks to add as well as specifying options for that track.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179639/storage/PNG_small_500px/179639-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179639/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/179639-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179639/storage/PNG_large_2000px/179639-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179639/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/179639-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">In this example an audio track has been added and you can choose the input routing, the number of tracks and their names before they are added.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">You can also access the same menu by going to the menu bar and choosing Project &gt; Add Track. It’s exactly the same process, just reached using a slightly different method.</p><h2 class="">Track Types In Cubase</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Now let’s look at what the different types of track are used for.</p><h3 class="">Audio track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Audio tracks let you record, import and edit digital audio. So every vocal, guitar or multitracked drum kit in your project will be recorded onto audio tracks. When you create an audio track you can choose what channels it receives and outputs sound on and you can of course change these settings after the tracks have been created as well.</p><h3 class="">Instrument track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Instrument tracks in Cubase are a clever timesaver. They combine a VST instrument and MIDI track in one and automatically route the instrument’s outputs to MixConsole. So you can create one in seconds, selecting a VST instrument and having it all set up and ready to play and record with no further setup.</p><h3 class="">MIDI track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">A MIDI track is for recording MIDI notes and data. It does not contain sound but must be connected to a MIDI destination, either a VST instrument or your MIDI interface, to send data out to an external hardware synth or workstation. A MIDI track could even just contain MIDI data like automation without containing any notes.</p><h3 class="">Sampler track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">A Sampler track contains an instance of Cubase’s built-in sampler. This isn’t a plug-in but an integrated part of Cubase. In the Sampler Control window that appears you can drop audio samples and then play them like you would on a hardware sampler, looping or slicing them up and adding effects. It can turn loops into playable instruments.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179642/storage/PNG_small_500px/179642-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179642/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/179642-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179642/storage/PNG_large_2000px/179642-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179642/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/179642-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h3 class="">Effect track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Effect tracks act like send effect channels on a hardware mixer and are available to other tracks with audio routing. They are a great way to process several tracks through a single effect. So you might, for example, create an Effect track with a compressor or reverb attached and then route every track of a multitracked drum kit, or a multitracked backing vocal through it, to ensure they all receive the same treatment.</p><h3 class="">Group track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Group tracks are a way to manage the audio outputs of several channels at once. In a similar way to Effect tracks, you can for example route a whole multitracked drum kit to a Group track and then change the level of the whole kit with a single Group fader. You can still submix the kit using individual channels’ faders of course.</p><h3 class="">Folder track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Folder tracks are simply a way of managing larger projects. If your project is getting big you can, for example, place all the synth tracks into a Folder track to free up space on the timeline, then expand that folder when you need to edit them. They also allow you to edit several tracks at the same time.</p><h3 class="">Ruler track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">You can add multiple Ruler tracks to show the timeline in different formats like bars and beats, seconds or timecode. This gives you a way to keep track of a project using different standards.</p><h3 class="">Arranger track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">This is a very useful track that lets you draw in “blocks” to create virtual playback arrangements without cutting up or duplicating lots of material on the timeline. Only one per project is allowed, but you can create multiple song structures or “chains” to try out different arrangements and then “flatten” any arrangement out to the existing project or to a whole new project.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179644/storage/PNG_small_500px/179644-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179644/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/179644-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179644/storage/PNG_large_2000px/179644-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/179644/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/179644-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h3 class="">Chord track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Chord tracks let you draw in chord and scale data which can transform the pitches of other events on the timeline. As well as helping you visually understand the harmonic structure of a project, MIDI and VariAudio parts can be made to follow the chord track, helping you to quickly change the key or scale of parts.</p><h3 class="">Marker track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Marker tracks let you add multiple markers within the timeline to quickly locate certain positions within the project which is handy for working with larger, more complex productions.</p><h3 class="">Video track</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">The Video track can be used to play back video files when you are composing music to picture. The video window can be placed on a second monitor if you have one.</p></article></div><div class="grid-container no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="grid-container no-gap full-width" data-testid="grid-container"><ul class="teaser teaser-steinberg-magazine-content-details"><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Are you new to Cubase?</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Get an overview<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/learn/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">More Cubase tutorials</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Learn Cubase with in-depth video tutorials<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/compare-editions/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Do you need more features?</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Compare the different Cubase versions<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><section data-widget-id="185057" id="185057" class="steinberg--text-media u-max-width-desktop section section--bright-background" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)), url(&quot;&quot;); width: 100%; min-height: auto; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;"><div class="grid-container text-media-default text-media-default--image-left text-media-default--desktop no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="equal-width-grid equal-width-grid-cols-1 sm:equal-width-grid-cols-2 md:equal-width-grid-cols-2 lg:equal-width-grid-cols-2" data-testid="equal-width-grid"><div class="image-content"><img alt="" class="image-src-set" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_small_500px/781420-small.jpg 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_medium_1000px/781420-medium.jpg 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_large_2000px/781420-large.jpg 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_extra-large_5500px/781420-extra-large.jpg 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"></div><div class="non-image-content"><h3 class="headline">Try Cubase free for 60 days</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Experience the DAW trusted by Hollywood composers, Billboard Hot 100  producers, and passionate beginners — built to take your music from the  first spark of inspiration to the final song.</p><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/trial/"><button type="button" class="smtg-button smtg-button--secondary button" value="" data-testid="">Try Cubase For Free</button></a></div></div></div></section>

An acronym for Digital Audio Workstation, DAWs cover every part of the music-making process from recording digital audio through creating beats and melodies with virtual instruments all the way to adding effects to make everything sound great and perfecting your final mix of all the tracks. They are all-in-one music creation suites that handle everything you might need to do on your musical journey.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--portrait" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/150225/storage/JPG_small_500px/150225-small.jpg 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/150225/storage/JPG_medium_1000px/150225-medium.jpg 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/150225/storage/JPG_large_2000px/150225-large.jpg 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/150225/storage/JPG_extra-large_5500px/150225-extra-large.jpg 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">DAWs can take audio input from your microphones, guitars and other instruments and record them as digital audio files to your computer’s hard drive. They can use MIDI data - Musical Instrument Digital Interface - to trigger your hardware synths and drum machines and also software plug-in instruments that run inside the DAW itself.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">With your audio and MIDI recorded, DAWs provide editing tools to let you change and manipulate those parts to create the perfect take or pattern. The DAW timeline is like a canvas on which you arrange and create your finished tracks. Every instrument or track has its own channel in the mixer, just like in a real recording studio, and you can use faders to perfectly balance them, adding plug-in effects like reverb and equalization (EQ) to make sure everything sounds great.</p><h2 class="">Why Were DAWs Created?</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Before software recording systems became commonplace, recording and producing music had to be done in a traditional recording studio, usually a facility with a large mixing desk. Recordings were done to tape in real time and editing meant chopping, splicing and overdubbing to that tape. It was a very manual process requiring lots of hardware and at least a few people to make it work.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">As computers started to become more powerful, parts of the production process began to move over to the software realm. Steinberg was one of the very first companies to forge this path, with the first version of Cubase triggering synths, samplers and drum machines using MIDI. Later, digital audio recording would come to Cubase and Steinberg would also develop the VST plug-in format for virtual instruments and effects.</p><h2 class="">What Can You Do With A DAW?</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Over time, DAWs took on more and more tools and capabilities and in the process, opened up the world of production to a much wider range of musicians, and at a much lower cost. You no longer needed lots of equipment, your DAW could replace a whole studio. And not just the recording side, but also the instruments and effects. Whole rooms of synths and effects racks could be replaced with your library of plug-ins, which take up no space. With an audio interface to record sound, a MIDI keyboard to program patterns and a pair of speakers for mixing, you can have a complete setup on a computer, even on a laptop or a tablet.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Whatever you’re doing, a DAW has you covered. At the simpler end of things you could be recording an acoustic guitar and a vocal, a singer songwriter. Or you might be making electronic music, programming lots of virtual synths and drum machines entirely inside the software. DAWs even include the ability to compose music along to a video, for film or TV scoring. Whatever combination of these things you are doing, such as recording a band but adding software synths for example, a DAW lets you do it all. It’s a true end-to-end solution.</p><h2 class="">What's Included In A DAW And What Should You Look Out For?</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">A DAW like Cubase has all the tools you need, whatever kind of music you are making. Audio tracks are used for capturing live sounds like vocals, guitars, drums or orchestral instruments. MIDI tracks let you program and edit chords, beats, melodies and patterns and have them played back by your software or hardware MIDI instruments. It has a full complement of plug-in effects from core mixing tools like EQ, reverb and compression through to more unusual delays and modulators if you want to get even more creative.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/153958/storage/JPG_small_500px/153958-small.jpg 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/153958/storage/JPG_medium_1000px/153958-medium.jpg 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/153958/storage/JPG_large_2000px/153958-large.jpg 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/153958/storage/JPG_extra-large_5500px/153958-extra-large.jpg 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">Everything you create or record can be edited inside your project and mistakes corrected or new ideas generated. You are completely free to create any arrangement you like, moving different parts of a song around and even trying multiple arrangements. When you’re happy with your song, powerful mixing tools let you tweak and balance not only the levels of every part but also their sound and character, using EQ and other processing plug-ins.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">A DAW, running on your computer, provides everything you need to make great music, a suite of tools that helps you to capture, create and blend ideas and come out at the end of the process with a track that’s ready for the world to hear.</p><h2 class="">Try It Out For Yourself Right Away</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Now you have learned what a DAW can do for you, it’s time to experience it for yourself.

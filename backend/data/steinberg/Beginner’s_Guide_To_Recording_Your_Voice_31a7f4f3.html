This guide will show you what you need to get started, how to record and how to polish up the end results.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/175422/storage/JPG_small_500px/175422-small.jpg 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/175422/storage/JPG_medium_1000px/175422-medium.jpg 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/175422/storage/JPG_large_2000px/175422-large.jpg 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/175422/storage/JPG_extra-large_5500px/175422-extra-large.jpg 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h2 class="">What Equipment Will You Need?</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">To record professional-sounding vocals you need three key things. The first is a microphone, the second is an audio interface and the third is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) like Cubase to do the actual recording. Let’s look at each of these.</p><h3 class="">Microphone</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">The most common type of microphone used for vocal recording is called a condenser microphone. These need to be attached to a microphone stand to avoid picking up unwanted noise. Good condenser mics start at between 100 and 200 Eur, and though you can pay a lot more, a well-chosen entry-level model will provide good results. You will also want to add a popshield to ensure the best vocal take possible.</p><h3 class="">Audio interface</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Good quality audio interfaces like Steinberg’s UR22C are affordable and connect to your computer using a USB cable. They take the signal from your microphone and convert it to digital audio that is recorded in your DAW.</p><h3 class="">Digital Audio Workstation</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">A DAW runs on your computer and is the software that captures the signal from your microphone into an audio track. It lets you edit the sound as well as adding effects to make it sound more professional.</p><h2 class="">How To Set Up A Recording</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">With your DAW and audio interface installed, connect the microphone to audio input 1 or 2 on the interface using its XLR cable. Connect your headphones to the audio interface, since you will need to listen on headphones while recording with a microphone to avoid feedback from loudspeakers.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">In Cubase, start a new project. There are some great template projects included which you can select from the welcome screen. You can find these in the Projects section under Recording. They even give you instructions on how to connect your sound sources.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173271/storage/PNG_small_500px/173271-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173271/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/173271-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173271/storage/PNG_large_2000px/173271-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173271/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/173271-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">In Cubase, go to the Studio menu and select Audio Connections. From the Audio Device menu, select your interface. This will make sure Cubase is looking in the right place for its audio signal.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">If your project doesn’t yet have an audio track you can add one by going to the Project menu at the top of the screen and choosing Add Track &gt; Audio. From the Audio Inputs menu choose the input on your interface you have connected your microphone to, such as Input 1. From the Configuration menu, select Mono. You can then name the track something like “vocals”.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173273/storage/PNG_small_500px/173273-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173273/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/173273-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173273/storage/PNG_large_2000px/173273-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173273/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/173273-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h2 class="">How Does A Recording Work?</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">The first thing to do is to set your volume. On your audio interface, and while wearing your headphones, adjust the channel’s input gain knob so that it is set at around 75-85%. In your audio track in Cubase, click on the monitor button – it looks like a small speaker and will light up orange. Now speak or sing into your microphone and you should hear yourself in the headphones and also see the level coming through in the audio track in Cubase.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173274/storage/PNG_small_500px/173274-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173274/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/173274-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173274/storage/PNG_large_2000px/173274-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173274/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/173274-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">It will help to have something to sing over, perhaps a backing track you have made in Cubase, or you might be playing and recording an acoustic guitar as you sing. You can use Cubase’s metronome to play you a click track as you record, to help you stay in time. Click on the Metronome setup button on the Transport panel and check that Use Audio Click is selected and that the metronome is active.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Now it’s as simple as moving the playhead in Cubase to the start of where you want to record, and pressing the Record button in the Transport panel. Cubase will record everything you sing into the microphone. Hit Stop or hit the Record button a second time to stop recording.</p><h2 class="">How To Make Your Recording Sound More Professional</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Once you have recorded your vocals you have some tools to help you make them sound even better. These come in two forms – edits and effects.</p><h3 class="">Editing your vocals</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">You’ll see your voice recorded as a block in the audio track in Cubase. You can use the Split tool which is shown as a small pair of scissors in the toolbar at the top to cut it up and move the different sections around. You can use this technique to combine different parts of different takes to ‘comp’ together the perfect final take.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173278/storage/PNG_small_500px/173278-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173278/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/173278-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173278/storage/PNG_large_2000px/173278-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173278/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/173278-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">When you edit your vocals in this way you might need to blend the end of one clip into the start of another. You can make sure this sounds smooth by using a crossfade. Select the two clips and go to the Audio menu, then select Fades &gt; Crossfade and Cubase will create a smooth transition for you.</p><h3 class="">Using Effects</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Plug-in VST effects can be used to enhance the sound of your vocals. In your audio track go to the Inspector panel on the left then click the Inserts tab. Click in slot 1 and then the EQ option, and choose StudioEQ. From the plug-in’s window, choose a lead vocal preset and you can then move the EQ points yourself to change the low, mid and high frequencies to suit your voice.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173280/storage/PNG_small_500px/173280-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173280/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/173280-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173280/storage/PNG_large_2000px/173280-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/173280/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/173280-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">Other effects that work well on vocals include reverb, which add a sense of space to the sound, and also compression which can be used to ensure the quieter and louder parts of a vocal are pulled closer together, making it sound more coherent overall. You can use Cubase’s Track Presets to load whole effects chains quickly that are tailored to your kind of voice.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">So recording vocals can be easy provided you follow these simple steps. Cubase makes it a breeze to capture, edit and process your voice and get excellent results.</p></article></div><div class="grid-container no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="grid-container no-gap full-width" data-testid="grid-container"><ul class="teaser teaser-steinberg-magazine-content-details"><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/audio-interfaces/ur22c-recording-pack/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Your Complete Recording Solution</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">UR22C Recording Pack<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Are you new to Cubase?</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Get an overview<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/learn/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">More Cubase tutorials</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Learn Cubase with in-depth video tutorials<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><section data-widget-id="170714" id="170714" class="steinberg--text-media u-max-width-desktop section section--bright-background" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)), url(&quot;&quot;); width: 100%; min-height: auto; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;"><div class="grid-container text-media-default text-media-default--image-right text-media-default--desktop no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="equal-width-grid equal-width-grid-cols-1 sm:equal-width-grid-cols-2 md:equal-width-grid-cols-2 lg:equal-width-grid-cols-2" data-testid="equal-width-grid"><div class="image-content"><img alt="" class="image-src-set" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/169825/storage/PNG_small_500px/169825-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/169825/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/169825-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/169825/storage/PNG_large_2000px/169825-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/169825/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/169825-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"></div><div class="non-image-content"><h2 class="headline">Try Cubase Out For Yourself Right Away</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Now you have learned what Cubase can do for you, it’s time to experience it for yourself.

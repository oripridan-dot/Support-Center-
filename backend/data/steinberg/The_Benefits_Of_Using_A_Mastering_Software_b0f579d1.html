Mastering isn’t processing, it’s a process. While you can do the stereo bus processing portion of the mastering process in any DAW really, using a mastering-focused DAW such as WaveLab will not only make your job easier, it can also allow you to work more accurately, efficiently, and with greater consistency.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">I know of some professional mastering engineers that are having to use multiple apps to get the job done which is not the most efficient use of time.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155054/storage/PNG_small_500px/155054-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155054/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/155054-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155054/storage/PNG_large_2000px/155054-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155054/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/155054-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h2 class="">What is mastering?</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Contrary to the belief of some, a mastering DAW is not just for creating a master for CD production. Even though some argue that CDs are dead, we still need to assemble and layout EP and album masters for streaming in a similar fashion. Also contrary to popular belief, CDs are not really dead, and I send off at least a few masters for CD production per week on average. So, having a program and environment that lets you work and create master files for any and all formats, CDs, streaming, vinyl, cassette, etc. is very beneficial.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">There is a lot more to mastering than just the stereo bus processing and while WaveLab does come with a number of great plug-ins such as MasterRig, LIN Pro Dithering, Frequency 2, and many more, WaveLab would still be my #1 choice for mastering if it came with no plug-ins at all.</p><h2 class="">Why I switched to a mastering DAW</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">I was drawn to WaveLab because of the mastering environment that it creates, not just because of the plug-ins it comes with. Whether I am mastering a single song, EP, or album, the Audio Montage of WaveLab provides an incredible place to do this kind of work. WaveLab has a few different workspaces including a Batch Processor and destructive Audio Editor, but in my opinion, the Audio Montage is WaveLab, and it’s where I do 100% of my mastering work.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">As I was transitioning from recording and mixing to mastering in the late 2000s, I knew Pro Tools was not cut out for the entire process of mastering. There are things that any recording and mixing DAW factually cannot do when it comes to mastering. I’ll explain these things throughout the article, but my point here is that I knew I needed something that was created for and specializes in mastering to do my best mastering work and offer it professionally. The thing is that I didn’t know what I didn’t know and had no idea how much using my current toolset at the time was slowing me down and holding me back.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Now let’s get to the fun stuff.</p><h2 class="">Advantages of a mastering DAW</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">As mentioned, there are many little and not so little reasons why working in WaveLab versus a recording/mixing DAW is more efficient and enjoyable. My only regret is putting off the inevitable and not doing it sooner.</p><h3 class="">Clip Effects</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">One big thing that separates a recording/mixing DAW and a mastering DAW in my opinion is the ability to use Clip Effects, which you can do in the Audio Montage of WaveLab. Too often I see people mastering an album in a recording/mixing DAW and they have each song on its own audio track and the files arranged in a “stair-step” layout one after another. There are so many reasons why I think this is a headache. With Clip Effects, you can arrange an EP or album’s worth of songs on just one or two tracks, which allows you to keep the waveforms nice and large on the screen, and it saves on screen real estate, but perhaps more importantly, it can save on CPU consumption. My computer used to get bogged down very easily when using the “stair step” layout. This is because instead of applying plug-ins on every track in your session that in many cases are always running where there is audio or not, with Clip Effects you’re essentially applying plug-ins to each song or audio clip which means that the plug-ins are only taxing the CPU when that song is being played back or rendering, not the entire session.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155047/storage/PNG_small_500px/155047-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155047/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/155047-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155047/storage/PNG_large_2000px/155047-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155047/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/155047-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">This approach also makes it easier when you have to change the song order of an EP or album master. You can simply drag a song (or clip) to the new position in the list and the rest of the song order and spacing relationships stay the same thanks to Ripple Editing. No need to clumsily move files around and rearrange them just to change the song order, or spacing between songs. Of course, you can still use Track Effects in WaveLab if you want to, and there is an Audio Montage Output Effects section for times when you do want to apply a plug-in or plug-ins such as final limiter or dither to an entire project at the end of the processing chain. Clip Effects are one main thing that separates a mastering DAW from a recording/mixing DAW. You can even split a song up into multiple clips if different parts of a song or piece need special treatment.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">I truly think that you need to experience working with Clip Effects to fully understand the power and flexibility they provide in a mastering context.</p><h3 class="">Timecode</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Another thing that would drive me absolutely nuts if I were trying to master an EP or album in a recording/mixing DAW is the timecode situation. Recording/mixing DAWs basically have one main timecode that starts at the beginning of the session, which is fine for recording or mixing, but in mastering, we often need to know the precise time of each song and when you have all the songs in a single master session as you do, one timecode for the entire session does not work.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">If a client says that at 2:43 on the 5th song there is an issue to listen for, I need to be able to quickly find that. The Timecode window in WaveLab has many options so you can quickly see the actual time of a CD/album track, the time within an Audio Clip, the entire project, and much more. Having to constantly guess and roughly measure where a certain time within a certain song/track is if I were using a recording/mixing DAW would be an absolute slowdown and annoyance.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155049/storage/PNG_small_500px/155049-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155049/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/155049-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155049/storage/PNG_large_2000px/155049-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155049/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/155049-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h3 class="">Metering</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">One of WaveLab’s best assets is the great built-in metering that it has. Yes, there are plenty of good third-party metering plug-ins out there but they can be a hassle to use in that you have to always insert them and manage them for each new project, plus they can take up screen real estate and require additional babysitting.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">WaveLab’s internal meters include a number of frequency-based meters, as well as loudness, live spectrogram, and a slightly nerdy but very practical and useful bit-depth meter.</p><div class="grid-container text-media-default text-media-default--desktop no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="equal-width-grid equal-width-grid-cols-1 sm:equal-width-grid-cols-1 md:equal-width-grid-cols-1 lg:equal-width-grid-cols-1" data-testid="equal-width-grid"><div class="image-content"></div><div class="text-content"></div><div class="additional-content"></div></div></div><p class="" role="paragraph">Users of Cubase and Nuendo will also be happy to know that the great Steinberg metering plug-in called Supervision is also available in WaveLab Pro 11 and while it can be inserted anywhere in an Audio Montage, a great place to insert it is in one of the five Playback Processing slots in the global Master Section.</p><h3 class="">Playback Processing</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Playback Processing slots are a great feature of WaveLab because with the global Master Section being not tied to any one project or file, you can keep plugins such as Supervision, TC Clarity M, or room/headphone correction software inserted in the Playback Processing section. Not only are those plug-ins automatically reloaded whenever you launch WaveLab, they are in no danger of accidentally being in the path of your rendered audio which especially in the case of room/headphone correction software, would be very bad.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">To summarize, the internal metering of WaveLab is perhaps the best set of software metering I’ve ever used and to have it all built right into the software is a huge asset and time saver. Also on this topic, the Audio Editor allows for very fast offline analysis of files which is useful for double-checking things before sending them out, or analyzing incoming files before you get started.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--portrait" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155052/storage/PNG_small_500px/155052-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155052/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/155052-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155052/storage/PNG_large_2000px/155052-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/155052/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/155052-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h3 class="">Reference Tracks</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">A more recent feature of WaveLab that I could now no longer live without is Reference Tracks. A Reference Track is a special track that can be added to an Audio Montage with the purpose of A/B comparing what you’re working on to something else. It could help you dial in the sound to match another mastered song, compare what you have dialed in to the original unmastered mix, to compare to the “faux mastering” that the mix engineer applied, or anything else you decide to place on that track.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">The beauty of a Reference Track is that any plug-in processing that you may have applied in the Audio Montage Output Effects or global Master Section is not applied to the Reference Track, so you hear exactly what is on that track without that audio traveling through any plug-ins you may have inserted in your Audio Montage session. There is also no danger of Reference Tracks being included in your rendered audio, or accidentally playing at the same time as the main audio in your session which can overload your main output and speakers.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Reference Tracks are a really elegant and well thought out way to be able to compare something to what you’re doing in your session, yet have them remain out of the way when not needed.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Aside from being helpful for comparing sounds, a Reference Track is a nice way to align the mastered versions up with a mockup of the song sequencing and/or crossfades. It makes it easy to both visually and audibly match your files up to an example of crossfaded songs or very specific song spacing that a client may have provided as a reference. This is something that I do somewhat often and could not live without now.</p><h3 class="">Integrating analog equipment</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">The last thing I’ll say about Reference Tracks is that they’re also useful for when you want to use analog equipment in your mastering process. WaveLab has had an External FX plug-in for a long time to help route audio to and from analog equipment, but I personally never cared for that method.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Starting with WaveLab 10 when Reference Tracks were added, you can now use a Reference Track to feed one or more stereo DAC units that go to your analog chain. With my setup, I have three DAC options to feed my analog chain. What’s nice is that I can place the unmastered mixes on a Reference Track in the Audio Montage, have that Reference Track feed all three DACs simultaneously and then choose the right DAC on my mastering console. This allows me to then record back from my analog chain on a normal Audio Montage track and then go from there. What’s also nice is that any clips on a Reference Track can also have their own Clip Effects chain before going analog if needed. It’s my preferred way to incorporate analog equipment into the process.</p><h2 class="">Conclusion</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">In conclusion, there is a fair amount of overlap between a recording/mixing DAW when it comes to some basic elements of audio processing, but if you are looking to improve your mastering workflow and need optimal tools to work more efficiently, confidently, and accurately when it comes to mastering, as well as do some things that a recording/mixing DAW cannot do, you will be doing yourself and your clients a big favor by using a dedicated mastering DAW which creates the environment to accomplish any and all mastering related tasks without friction, frustration, or having to use multiple apps to get the job done.</p></article></div><div class="grid-container no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="grid-container no-gap full-width" data-testid="grid-container"><ul class="teaser teaser-steinberg-magazine-content-details"><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/wavelab/elements/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">The first choice in mastering for aspiring musicians</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">WaveLab Elements<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/wavelab/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">The number one mastering software for professionals</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">WaveLab Pro<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/wavelab/learn/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Mastering for beginners – improve your sound!</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">WaveLab Academy online courses<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><section data-widget-id="170717" id="170717" class="steinberg--text-media u-max-width-desktop section section--bright-background" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)), url(&quot;&quot;); width: 100%; min-height: auto; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;"><div class="grid-container text-media-default text-media-default--image-right text-media-default--desktop no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="equal-width-grid equal-width-grid-cols-1 sm:equal-width-grid-cols-2 md:equal-width-grid-cols-2 lg:equal-width-grid-cols-2" data-testid="equal-width-grid"><div class="image-content"><img alt="" class="image-src-set image-src-set__fallback" loading="lazy" srcset="" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"></div><div class="non-image-content"><h2 class="headline">Try WaveLab Out For Yourself Right Away</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Now you have learned what WaveLab can do for you, it’s time to experience it for yourself.

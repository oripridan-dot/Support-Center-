These cover everything from spatial effects like reverb, echo and delay through to equalizers, dynamics like compression and limiting, and tonal effects like saturation. Effects can be applied in a number of ways depending on how you like to work and what you are trying to achieve and the great news is that you can use as many as your computer can handle. So let’s look at how to apply effects in Cubase.</p><h2 class="">Apply Effects As Inserts</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">The most common way to use audio effects is to add them to insert slots. Every channel in Cubase that carries audio has several insert slots and you can find these either in the track Inspector for the channel, by opening its Channel window or by opening MixConsole. These three views all show you the same insert slots for a channel.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--portrait" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181848/storage/PNG_small_500px/181848-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181848/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/181848-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181848/storage/PNG_large_2000px/181848-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181848/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/181848-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">By clicking in a slot you will see the effect picker window pop up. Cubase sorts all your installed audio plug-ins into categories and this includes any extra third-party VST plug-ins that you may install. You can click to expand any category and double click to load an effect, or use the search bar at the top of this window to quickly search for an effect by name. Cubase Artist and Pro also have MIDI effects which can be added to MIDI-capable channels and modify the MIDI signal in real time.</p><h2 class="">Managing Inserts</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">From any of the views of your Inserts strip you can click on an effect to open it and make settings. You can also drag and drop effects between slots and even between channels, and copy and paste them between slots too which is a great way to quickly add the exact same processing to more than one channel. If you right click on an effect slot you can copy an effect’s setting and then paste it into another instance of that effect. You can bypass an effect using its Bypass button and remove it by going back to the effect picker window and choosing “No Effect.”</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Another way to&nbsp; view and load effects is to expand the Right Zone of the Project window using the Right Zone button and click on the VST Effects window, then search or choose an effect from the list. Clicking on an effect will show a list of its presets and you can drag a preset onto a track to apply it. You can also drag and drop any effect directly from the Right Zone onto a track either using its picture or if you are viewing in list mode, by picking up an effect by its name and dragging and dropping it onto a track.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">You can also find all your plug-in and track presets in the MediaBay. Press F5 or choose Media &gt; MediaBay from the menu bar. From the Filter menu, choose to show plug-in or track presets and also enter a search term if you need to find a specific preset. You can drag and drop any preset from the MediaBay onto any audio track to apply it.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181850/storage/PNG_small_500px/181850-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181850/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/181850-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181850/storage/PNG_large_2000px/181850-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181850/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/181850-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h2 class="">Apply Effects Using Track And FX Presets</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Cubase lets you save and load multi-presets for effects chains and even whole track setups. These can be great timesavers, pulling up a whole set of effects in just a couple of clicks. Let’s say you have a vocal chain that suits your voice or a favourite guitar sound — just save it as a preset and load it instantly. In the Inserts section for a track, click on the Preset Management button in its header.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181851/storage/PNG_small_500px/181851-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181851/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/181851-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181851/storage/PNG_large_2000px/181851-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181851/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/181851-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><p class="" role="paragraph">If you click on Load FX Chain you will see a list of presets that come with Cubase covering everything from guitars and drums to vocals and mixing. Choosing any one of these will load up a whole chain. From that same menu you can also save any chain you have created or modified.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">Track Presets are even more powerful and contain not just effects chains but also EQ and other settings. If you choose this option you will see a bunch of presets tailored to specific things like female vocals, choirs, spoken word and more. Choosing one of these presets will load up all the settings, providing you an excellent starting point for shaping your sound.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--portrait" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181853/storage/PNG_small_500px/181853-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181853/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/181853-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181853/storage/PNG_large_2000px/181853-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181853/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/181853-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h2 class="">Other Ways To Apply Effects</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Using effects as inserts on audio or Instrument tracks is the most common way of applying them but you can also use two other types of tracks — FX and Group tracks — to add effects. An FX track, also known as a send effect track, contains one or more effects and you can use the Send section of any other track to route audio through it. Group tracks also have this facility and both can be used to process several tracks through the same effect, say for example applying the same amount of compression to every track in a multitracked drum kit. You can add these and other tracks from the Project &gt; Add Track menu.</p><img alt="" class="image-src-set text-media-article__image--landscape" loading="lazy" sizes="(min-width: 1200px) calc(1/1 * (1200px - (2rem * 2))),(min-width: 768px) calc(1/1 * (100vw - (2rem * 2))),calc(1/1 * (100vw - (1rem * 2)))" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181854/storage/PNG_small_500px/181854-small.png 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181854/storage/PNG_medium_1000px/181854-medium.png 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181854/storage/PNG_large_2000px/181854-large.png 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/181854/storage/PNG_extra-large_5500px/181854-extra-large.png 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"><h2 class="">Other Things To Know</h2><p class="" role="paragraph">Audio effects remain “live” as long as they are active, and process sound in real time. They can be bypassed to mute them, or “frozen” using the Track Freeze button to render them down, after which the effect can’t be edited until you unfreeze the track. When you export your final mixdown, all the audio effects you have used will be included unless you mute them. The more advanced versions of Cubase have expanded options when it comes to exporting stems with and without effects.</p><p class="" role="paragraph">So using audio effects in Cubase is quick and easy, and whether you’re just adding some simple reverbs and compressors or taking things to the next level with delays and modulators, they’re guaranteed to help you make great-sounding productions.</p></article></div><div class="grid-container no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="grid-container no-gap full-width" data-testid="grid-container"><ul class="teaser teaser-steinberg-magazine-content-details"><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Are you new to Cubase?</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Get an overview<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/learn/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">More Cubase tutorials</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Learn Cubase with in-depth video tutorials<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li><li class="teaser__list-item link-variant"><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/compare-editions/"><h3 class="teaser__list-item__headline">Do you need more features?</h3><p class="teaser__list-item__paragraph" role="paragraph">Compare the different Cubase versions<svg stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" stroke-width="0" viewBox="0 0 512 512" height="1em" width="1em" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M192 128l128 128-128 128z"></path></svg></p></a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></section><section data-widget-id="185057" id="185057" class="steinberg--text-media u-max-width-desktop section section--bright-background" style="background-image: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)), url(&quot;&quot;); width: 100%; min-height: auto; background-repeat: no-repeat; background-size: cover;"><div class="grid-container text-media-default text-media-default--image-left text-media-default--desktop no-gap padding-x" data-testid="grid-container"><div class="equal-width-grid equal-width-grid-cols-1 sm:equal-width-grid-cols-2 md:equal-width-grid-cols-2 lg:equal-width-grid-cols-2" data-testid="equal-width-grid"><div class="image-content"><img alt="" class="image-src-set" loading="lazy" srcset="https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_small_500px/781420-small.jpg 500w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_medium_1000px/781420-medium.jpg 1000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_large_2000px/781420-large.jpg 2000w, https://ocl-steinberg-live.steinberg.net/_storage/asset/781420/storage/JPG_extra-large_5500px/781420-extra-large.jpg 5500w" src="/static/imgPlaceholder/img-placeholder.png"></div><div class="non-image-content"><h3 class="headline">Try Cubase free for 60 days</h3><p class="" role="paragraph">Experience the DAW trusted by Hollywood composers, Billboard Hot 100  producers, and passionate beginners — built to take your music from the  first spark of inspiration to the final song.</p><a class="link--wrapper" href="/cubase/trial/"><button type="button" class="smtg-button smtg-button--secondary button" value="" data-testid="">Try Cubase For Free</button></a></div></div></div></section>

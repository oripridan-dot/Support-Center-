Its nested Midwoofer-Tweeter-Midwoofer (MTM) configuration offers improved off-axis response and spatial resolution. The result is a more consistent listening experience, smoother frequency response, and an ultra-wide, detailed stereo soundstage.\nConventional two-way speaker designs can cause significant early reflections from their surrounding environment. The Eris E66 studio monitor overcomes this by positioning a 1.25-inch, silk dome, high-frequency driver between two 6.5-inch midrange drivers that cover the same frequency range.\nThe combined signal of the two relatively small drivers propagates forward like a single waveform, behaving like a single, larger driver. This mutual coupling provides a highly dynamic output in a compact footprint resulting in size-defying bass reproduction. At the same time, the two smaller woofers work in parallel to partially contain the dispersion of the tweeter, minimizing phase displacement. The result is incredibly detailed stereo imaging.\nLike all Eris studio monitors, the E66 offers flexible connectivity and extensive acoustic tuning controls. The three-position Acoustic Space switch plus High and Mid controls help to mitigate room anomalies. A Low Cutoff filter makes it easy to integrate a Temblor\u00ae subwoofer into your monitor setup.\nOverview\nFeatures\nNested MTM (D'Appolito) design with dual woven composite drivers provides smooth on- and off-axis response with more dynamic output than conventional two-way studio monitor configurations\nMTM (D'Appolito) design minimizes phase displacement and leads to improved spatial resolution and a much wider sweet spot\nDual 6.5-inch, custom-woven Kevlar LF/midrange drivers produce dynamic, size-defying bass output\n1.25-inch, silk-dome HF driver ensures smooth high-frequency performance that is never fatiguing to the ears\n140W Class A/B bi-amplification for an open, clear, and less fatiguing listening experience\n\u00d7\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nHighlights\nHorizontal or Vertical. It\u2019s up to you.\nMany MTM speakers must be arrayed vertically to provide a clear, interference-free midrange and treble reproduction to either side. With their nested MTM design, Eris E66 studio monitors are able to perform optimally in both orientations, letting you position your speaker the way that works best for you.\nDesigned to sound their best in any room.\nEris E66 studio monitors are equipped with Acoustic Tuning controls to ensure the flattest response in your mix environment. You get Low-cut, Mid, and High controls, as well as three-way Acoustic Space tuning that makes it easy to compensate for the boundary bass boost that occurs when a speaker is placed too close to a wall.\nSpecs\nAccessories\nFootswitch\nNA\nElectronics\nInput Impedance\n10 k\u03a9\nVoltageRequirements\n100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz\nGeneral\nColor\nBlack\nProduct Name\nEris\u00ae E66 Studio Monitor, Black\nSeries\nEris\u00ae\nHardware\nAudio Controls\nVolume Range: A-Type Taper\nMF Control: Variable (-6 to +6 dB)\nHF Control: Variable (-6 to +6 dB)\nLow Cut: Flat, 80 Hz, 100 Hz\nAcoustic Space: Flat, -2 dB, -4 dB\nCabinet Material\nVinyl-Laminated, Medium-Density Fiberboard\nHF Transducers\n1.25\u201d Silk Dome Tweeter\nLF Transducers\nDual 6.5\"\nMonitor Inputs\n1 x Balanced XLR, 1 x Balanced 1/4\" TRS, 1 x Unbalanced RCA\nMeasurements\nProduct Depth\n8.5\" (21.59 cm)\nProduct Height\n9.8\" (25.0 cm)\nProduct Width\n18.12\" (460 mm)\nMiscellaneous\nPower Cable\nIEC\nProtections\nRF Interference\nOutput-Current Limiting\nOver-Temperature\nTurn-On/Off Transient\nSubsonic Filter\nExternal Mains Fuse\nPerformance\nPeak SPL\n106 dB (at 1 Meter)\nSpeakers\nCrossover Frequency\n2.4 kHz",

Compact, affordable and capable of a stunningly wide range of tones, the BlueTube DP V2 offers two independent channels with combo mic/instrument inputs and unbalanced \u00bc-inch and balanced XLR line outputs. You can use it as a preamp and as a direct box (DI) for guitars and basses. Singer-songwriters can run the vocal through one channel and a guitar through the other, feeding both to the PA  -  no guitar amp needed.\nEach channel features one of PreSonus' famed XMAX Class A solid-state preamps, followed in the signal path by a 12AX7 vacuum-tube stage that's hand-selected and carefully tested for top audio performance. When the Tube Drive control is clicked off, you're using the solid-state preamp for quiet, clean transparent amplification; when engaged, your signals flow through the tube preamp, and you can achieve anything from gentle warmth to edgy distortion.\nWe didn't forget the extras: an 80 Hz highpass filter, phantom power, a -20 dB pad to control hot input signals, polarity reverse and a backlit VU meter. Housed in a rugged case small enough to carry in a gig bag or screw-mount in half a standard rack tray, the BlueTube DP V2 is a great-sounding tool you'll use on a variety of sources.\nOverview\nFeatures\n2 Balanced combo mic/unbalanced instrument inputs\n2 High-headroom Class A XMAX mic preamplifiers with 80 dB gain range and 48V phantom power and 12AX7 vacuum tube gain stage with Tube Drive tube-saturation control\n80 Hz high-pass filter\n-20 dB pad to reduce hot input levels\nPolarity-reverse switch\nIlluminated analog VU input-level meter\n2 balanced XLR and 2 unbalanced \u00bc-inch main (L/R) line outputs\nCompact 1/2U chassis\nExternal 12 VDC, 1A power supply\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nSpecs\nElectronics\nChannels\nTwo\nVoltageRequirements\n100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz\nGeneral\nColor\nBlue\nProduct Name\nBlueTube DP v2, Blue, 120V\nSeries\nMicrophone Preamps\nInputs\nInstrument Input Connection Type\n1/4\u201d TS Female, Unbalanced, Hi-Z\nMicrophone Preamp Input Impedance\n1.3 k\u03a9\nMicrophone Preamp Total Harmonic Distortion\nTube Stage: 0.01% to 30% (Unweighted), Solid-State: <0.005% (Unweighted)\nMeasurements\nProduct Depth\n5.5\" (139.7 mm)\nProduct Height\n1.75\" (44.45 mm)\nProduct Height/Length\n1.75\" (44.45 mm)\nProduct Width\n9.5\" (241mm)\nMiscellaneous\nPower Cable\n12 VDC, 1A, External Power Supply\nOutput\nMain And Line Outputs Output Impedance\n51\u03a9",

You get clear, articulate speech intelligibility and natural music reproduction thanks to its highly focused pattern with consistent SPL throughout the frequency response range, both on- and off-axis.\nEach CDL12 consists of eight 2-inch drivers aligned in a segmented circular-arc high-frequency array centered in front of a 12-inch woofer. Because the output of the low-frequency driver travels from the same acoustic axis as the high-frequency array, the pattern always radiates from the center. This is true whether the CDL12 is used individually or as part of an acoustically coupled vertical array with up to six enclosures. This unique design avoids the near-field anomalies that can interfere with the sound quality of a traditional line array by creating a far-field response almost as soon as the sound is projected from the center of the enclosure.\nIntegrated pin-loaded rigging hardware makes create an array fast and easy. A dual-angle pole mount is also provided, supporting the use of one or two enclosures when pole mounted on a tripod stand, or atop the companion CDL18s subwoofer. For suspended applications, up to five CDL12 enclosures can be flown beneath one or two CDL18s subwoofers. When flown without a subwoofer, six CDL12 loudspeakers can be arrayed to create a truly symmetric 120\u02da x 120\u02da design.\nOverview\nFeatures\nContinuous-directivity constant curve array with eight 2-inch cone drivers disperses sound 120\u00b0 horizontally\n20\u02da vertical directivity can be extended from 40\u02da up to 120\u02da with additional arrayable CDL12s\n12-inch, long-throw LF transducer with 2.5-inch voice coil\nLow 420 Hz crossover point minimizes comb filtering and enhances line array intelligibility\n500 x 500 watts Class D power for high SPLs and lightning-fast transient response\nHigh-pass filter\nRemote control via Worx Control software for macOS and Windows, including compression, polarity invert, limiting, delay, 8-band EQ and preset selection\n35 mm pole socket with 7.5\u02da downward tilt for use with up to two CDL12 on a tripod or atop PreSonus\u00ae CDL18s subwoofer\nIntegrated flyware to create an array of up to six CDL12s\nSignal, -3 dB, Limiter Protection, and Clip Monitoring\nRugged enclosure and tour-grade, 1.2 mm steel grille\nSix-year Warranty\n\u00d7\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nSoftware\nPreSonus\u00ae Worx Control 1.5.0.58513 (Mac)\nPreSonus\u00ae Worx Control 1.5.0.58513 (Windows)\nWorx Control 1.4 (Mac)\nWorx Control 1.4 (Windows)\nCDL12 - EASE Loudspeaker File - v1\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nHighlights\nThe CDL12\u2019s Constant Directivity Design\nThe eight 2-inch high-frequency drivers arc over a single 12-inch woofer are comparable to the coaxial driver configuration found in professional studio monitors. The result is better sonic coherence across the entire venue.\nMore About the CDL12\u2019s HF Driver Array\nThe 2-inch cones\u2019 fast transient response is matched for high- and mid-range reproduction. This is enhanced by setting the internal crossover to 420 Hz, so the CDL12 reproduces audio seamlessly, with no gaps at the heart of the musical range. This also minimizes comb filtering between 12-inch bass drivers in an array for a smooth low-mid response.\nCDL12 Power Amplification\nEach 2-inch speaker in the high-frequency driver array has a 1-inch voice coil, and the entire array is driven by a 500W Class D amplifier. Because the power is shared across eight voice coils, power compression is reduced, resulting in an efficient design and a flatter phase response for less fatiguing listening and a refined, balanced sound.\nWorx Control Software\nWorx Control software provides CDL-series management tools, including compression, limiting, and 800 ms of delay. An eight-band EQ with individually selectable filter types compensates for room anomalies. Speakers can be grouped and managed individually or together. Performance monitoring indicators monitor temperature and signal levels.\nCDL-series Rigging Accessories\nCDL loudspeakers and rigging hardware are rated for a 10:1 load.

If you're mixing or mastering high-resolution audio, the R80 V2 will ensure that you hear every nuance, thanks to its custom 6.8-inch Air Motion Transformer (AMT) tweeter that responds to the subtlest waveforms and the highest frequencies. You'll hear all of the air and space that has become synonymous with high-resolution audiophile sessions. The AMT design also allows the R80 V2 to handle 8 to 13 times the projection area of more traditional tweeter designs - while its unique housing constrains this projection area strictly to the horizontal axis. The result is a very wide sweet spot with focused vertical dispersion - minimizing reflections from your desk, floor, or ceiling.\nThe 8-inch, custom coated, woven composite LF driver produces a more dynamic output than conventional designs, thanks to the rigid cone's ability to maintain a more constant dispersion pattern across its frequency response range, resulting in transparent sound with reduced reflections. Biamped with 140W RMS of Class A/B power - 75 W driving the woofer and 45 W driving the tweeter - the R80 V2 ranks among the most powerful monitor speakers in its category.\nA set of four acoustic tuning controls allow you to tailor the R80 V2's frequency response to compensate for the anomalies of nearly any mix environment - so you can expect predictable, consistent performance in the event you use them in more than one place.\nOverview\nFeatures\n2-way active AMT tweeter design provides articulate high-frequency response, wide stereo imaging, and narrow vertical dispersion\nCustom-designed, 6.8-inch, AMT tweeter responds to the subtlest waveforms and the highest frequencies for audiophile-grade air and space\n8-inch LF drivers provide transparent mid- and low-frequency reproduction for clean, punchy bass\nBiamped, 140W RMS (LF = 75 W, HF = 65 W) Class A/B power amplifier with switching power supply\nAcoustic tuning controls (Low cut, Mid, High, Acoustic Space) compensate for room acoustics and placement\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nHighlights\nSet up your studio monitors for your room.\nR80 V2 studio monitors are equipped with Acoustic Tuning controls to ensure the flattest response in your mix environment.

Now that same constant-directivity performance is available in the new CDL12P, a lighter-weight design ideal for touring bands and mobile DJs who want the same scalability and sonic performance in portable design.\nLike the CDL12, CDL12P is the result of years of research and development, combining the best attributes of point source and line array technology into a unique patent-pending design. You get clear, articulate speech intelligibility and natural music reproduction thanks to its highly focused pattern with consistent SPL throughout the frequency response range, both on- and off-axis.\nThe CDL12P's hybrid point-source/line-array design delivers focused sound with consistent SPL coverage both on- and off-axis, making it an excellent choice for mobile and installed applications. Rigging CDL12P enclosures is made easier thanks to integrated pin-loaded rigging hardware. A dual-angle pole mount is provided, supporting the use of one or two enclosures when pole-mounted. The CDL12P's integrated 500W x 500W Class D power amplifier features onboard DSP presets to facilitate and simplify arrayed configurations.\nOverview\nFeatures\nContinuous-directivity constant curve array with eight 2-inch cone drivers disperses sound 120\u00b0 horizontally\n15\u02da vertical directivity can be extended from 30\u02da up to 90\u02da with additional arrayable CDL12Ps\n12-inch, long-throw LF transducer with 2.5-inch voice coil\nLow 420 Hz crossover point minimizes comb filtering and enhances line array intelligibility\n500 x 500 watts Class D power for high SPLs and lightning-fast transient response\nOnboard DSP: 90 High-pass filter, Array Mode (1-6 boxes), Sub Mode (Off, CDL18s, ULT18, or AIR18s)\n35 mm pole socket with 7.5\u02da downward tilt for use with up to two CDL12P on a tripod or atop PreSonus\u00ae CDL18s or ULT18 subwoofer\nIntegrated flyware to create an array of up to six CDL12Ps\nSignal, -3 dB, Limiter Protection, and Clip Monitoring\nRugged, lightweight plastic enclosure and tour-grade, 1.2 mm steel grille  -  great for touring bands and mobile DJs\n\u00d7\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nSoftware\nCDL12P EASE Loudspeaker File - v2.101\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nHighlights\nThe CDL12P\u2019s Constant Directivity Design\nEach CDL12P consists of 8 2-inch drivers aligned in a segmented, circular-arc, HF array centered in front of a 12-inch woofer. The output of the LF driver travels from the same acoustic axis as the HF array so the pattern always radiates from the center. This avoids near-field anomalies and makes the CDL12P ideal for a broad range of venue sizes.\nMore About the CDL12P\u2019s HF Driver Array\nThe 2-inch cones\u2019 fast transient response is matched for high- and mid-range reproduction. This is enhanced by setting the internal crossover to 420 Hz, so the CDL12P reproduces audio seamlessly, with no gaps at the heart of the musical range. This also minimizes comb filtering between 12-inch bass drivers in an array for a smooth low-mid response.\nCDL12P Power Amplification\nEach 2-inch speaker in the high-frequency driver array has a 1-inch voice coil, and the entire array is driven by a 500W Class D amplifier. Because the power is shared across eight voice coils, power compression is reduced, resulting in an efficient design and a flatter phase response for less fatiguing listening and a refined, balanced sound.\nCDL-series Rigging Accessories\nCDL loudspeakers and rigging hardware are rated for a 10:1 load. The CDL Rigging Grid is required for flown installations. The CDL Rigging Extension Bar provides tilt control. The CDL Rigging Sling is required with 4 or more CDL loudspeakers in a vertical array and when using the CDL Rigging Extension Bar with a tilt of 12\u02da or greater.\nPreSonus\u00ae Six-Year Warranty\nWhen you choose CDL-series loudspeakers and subwoofers, you choose confidence. Rest assured that your PreSonus\u00ae speakers are in it for the long haul. We take our build quality seriously, and if anything goes wrong with them in your first six years of ownership (assuming you don\u2019t abuse them), the repair or replacement is on us.\nSpecs\nElectronics\nAuxiliary Input\nN/A\nChannels\nOne\nInputs\nOne - 1 XLR\nLine Out\nOne - Direct Line Out (XLR)\nPower Consumption\n4.2A\nVoltageRequirements\n100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz\nGeneral\nAmplifier Type\nClass-D\nColor\nBlack\nProduct Name\nCDL12P Constant Directivity Sound Reinforcement Loudspeaker, Black\nSeries\nCDL\nHardware\nAudio Controls\nPreset Select (Number of Arrayed Boxes)\nHPF On/Off\nPreSonus Subwoofer Configuration Preset (None, CDL18s, ULT18, AIR18s)\nCabinet Material\n15mm Eucalyptus Plywood\nCooling\nFree Air Convection\nGrille Material\nPowder-Coated Steel\nHF Powere\n1000W Peak, 500W Program (250W RMS)\nHF Transducers\n8 x 2\u201d (1\u201d Voice Coil)\nHandle\n2 Side\nLF Power\n1000W Peak, 500W Program (250W RMS)\nLF Transducers\n12\u201d (2.5\u201d Voice Coil)\nPole Socket\nDual-position pole mount (0\u02da and 7.5\u02da)\nInputs\nLine Inputs Impedance\n40 k\u03a9\nMeasurements\nProduct Depth\n18.25\" (46.4 cm)\nProduct Height\n18.5\" (47.0 cm)\nProduct Width\n20.5\" (52.1 cm)\nMiscellaneous\nPower Cable\nLocking AC In and Out\nProtections\nAmplifier: Over-Current, DC, Over/Under-Voltage, Over-Temperature, High Frequency\nTransducer: Limiter\nSuspension\nIntegrated Rigging (10:1 Load)\nPerformance\nAmplifier Dynamic Range\n119 dB (A-Weighted)\nPeak SPL\n130 dB\nTotal Harmonic Distortion\n<0.05% (20 Hz - 20 kHz)\nTotal Power Output\n2000W Peak, 1000W Program (500W RMS)\nSpeakers\nCoverage Pattern\n120 degree (H) x 15 degree (V)\nCrossover Frequency\n420 Hz\nSpeaker Type\nActive 2-Way\nTotal Impedance\nNA",

Custom coated, woven, 6.5-inch LF drivers produce a more dynamic output than conventional designs, thanks to the rigid cone's ability to maintain a more constant dispersion pattern across its frequency response range. The result is transparent sound with narrow vertical dispersion, which reduces undesirable reflections, and broad horizontal dispersion for a wide sweet spot. Driven by a 150W Class D amplifier, the biamped R65 delivers an open, clear, and less fatiguing listening experience. Acoustic Space controls help compensate for room anomalies, and an onboard highpass filter to easily to add a subwoofer, making the R65 an ideal choice for any professional listening environment. An interchangeable black faceplate is included so you can customize your R65 studio monitors to fit your studio.\nSold Individually.\nOverview\nFeatures\n2-way active AMT design provides articulate high-frequency response and wide stereo imaging\nCustom-designed, 6.8-inch, AMT ribbon tweeter responds to the subtlest waveforms and the highest frequencies\n6.5-inch Kevlar LF drivers provide transparent mid- and low-frequency reproduction for clean sound and punchy bass\nBiamped 150W RMS (LF = 100W, HF = 50W), Class D power amplifier with switching power supply\nAcoustic Space settings (Linear, -1.5 dB, -3 dB, -6 dB) compensate for room placement\nBalanced XLR and \u00bc-inch TRS plus unbalanced RCA inputs provide flexibility for seamless integration into any environment\nRF interference, output current limiting, over temperature, turn-on/off transient, and subsonic filter protection\nInterchangeable black faceplate included\nEnergy Conservation Mode (with enable/disable) lowers standby power to <0.5W\nExternal mains fuse\nPower: 100-120V, 60 Hz or 220-240V, 50 Hz\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nSpecs\nAccessories\nFootswitch\nNA\nIncluded Accessories\nInterchangeable Black Faceplate\nElectronics\nInput Impedance\n20 k\u03a9 Balanced, 10 k\u03a9 Unbalanced\nVoltageRequirements\n100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz\nGeneral\nColor\nBlack\nProduct Name\nR65 Studio Monitor, Black with Interchangeable Black and Blue Faceplates\nSeries\nR\nHardware\nAudio Controls\nVolume Range: A-type taper\nAudio Switches\nHF Driver:\tLinear, +1 dB, -3 dB, -6 dB\nHighpass Filter: Linear, 60 Hz, 80 Hz, 100 Hz\nAcoustic Space:\tLinear, -1.5 dB, -3 dB, -6 dB\nEnergy Conservation Mode: On/Off/Query\nCabinet Material\nVinyl-Laminated, Medium-Density Fiberboard\nHF Transducers\nAMT\nLF Transducers\n6.5\" Woven Composite\nMonitor Inputs\n1- Balanced XLR, 1- Balanced \u00bc\u201d TRS, 1- Unbalanced RCA\nPower Amplifier Type\nClass D\nMeasurements\nProduct Depth\n10.3\" (26.16 cm)\nProduct Height\n13\" (33.02 cm)\nProduct Width\n8\" (20.32 cm)\nMiscellaneous\nPower Cable\nIEC\nProtections\nRF interference\nOutput-current limiting\nOver-temperature\nTurn-on/off transient\nSubsonic filter\nExternal mains fuse\nOutput\nMonitor Signal To Noise Ratio\n>100 dB\nPerformance\nPeak SPL\n(@ 1 meter) 104 dB\nSpeakers\nCrossover Frequency\n2.7 kHz",

Now that same constant-directivity performance is available in the new CDL10P, a lighter-weight design ideal for touring bands and mobile DJs who want the same scalability and sonic performance in portable design.\nLike the CDL12P, CDL10P is the result of years of research and development, combining the best attributes of point source and line array technology into a unique patent-pending design. You get clear, articulate speech intelligibility and natural music reproduction thanks to its highly focused pattern with consistent SPL throughout the frequency response range, both on- and off-axis.\nThe CDL10P's hybrid point-source/line-array design delivers focused sound with consistent SPL coverage both on- and off-axis, making it an excellent choice for mobile and installed applications. Rigging CDL10P enclosures is made easier thanks to integrated pin-loaded rigging hardware. A dual-angle pole mount is provided, supporting the use of one or two enclosures when pole-mounted. The CDL10P's integrated 500W x 500W Class D power amplifier features onboard DSP presets to facilitate and simplify arrayed configurations.\nOverview\nFeatures\nContinuous-directivity constant curve array with six 2-inch cone drivers disperses sound 120\u00b0 horizontally\n15\u02da vertical directivity can be extended from 30\u02da up to 90\u02da with additional arrayable CDL10P's\n10-inch, long-throw LF transducer with 2.5-inch voice coil\nLow 420 Hz crossover point minimizes comb filtering and enhances line array intelligibility\n500 x 500 watts Class D power for high SPLs and lightning-fast transient response\nOnboard DSP: 90 High-pass filter, Array Mode (1-6 boxes), Sub Mode (Off, CDL18s, ULT18, or AIR18s)\n35 mm pole socket with 7.5\u02da downward tilt for use with up to two CDL10P on a tripod or atop PreSonus\u00ae CDL Sub18, CDL18s or ULT18 subwoofer\nIntegrated flyware to create an array of up to six CDL10P's\nSignal, -3 dB, Limiter Protection, and Clip Monitoring\nRugged, lightweight plastic enclosure and tour-grade, 1.2 mm steel grille  -  great for touring bands and mobile DJs\n\u00d7\nDownloads\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nDocumentation\nSoftware\nCDL10P EASE Loudspeaker File - Array - v0.5\nCDL10P EASE Loudspeaker File - Single - v0.5\nDon't see what you're looking for?\nLog in to your\nmy.presonus.com\naccount.\nHighlights\nThe CDL10P\u2019s Constant Directivity Design\nEach CDL10P consists of 6 2-inch drivers aligned in a segmented, circular-arc, HF array centered in front of a 10-inch woofer. The output of the LF driver travels from the same acoustic axis as the HF array so the pattern always radiates from the center. This avoids near-field anomalies and makes the CDL10P ideal for a broad range of venue sizes.\nMore About the CDL10P\u2019s HF Driver Array\nThe 2-inch cones\u2019 fast transient response is matched for high- and mid-range reproduction. This is enhanced by setting the internal crossover to 420 Hz, so the CDL10P reproduces audio seamlessly, with no gaps at the heart of the musical range. This also minimizes comb filtering between 10-inch bass drivers in an array for a smooth low-mid response.\nCDL10P Power Amplification\nEach 2-inch speaker in the high-frequency driver array has a 1-inch voice coil, and the entire array is driven by a 500W Class D amplifier. Because the power is shared across six voice coils, power compression is reduced, resulting in an efficient design and a flatter phase response for less fatiguing listening and a refined, balanced sound.\nCDL-series Rigging Accessories\nCDL loudspeakers and rigging hardware are rated for a 10:1 load. The CDL10P Rigging Grid is required for flown installations. The CDL Rigging Extension Bar provides tilt control. The CDL10P Rigging Sling is required with 4 or more CDL loudspeakers in a vertical array and when using the CDL Rigging Extension Bar with a tilt of 12\u02da or greater.\nPreSonus\u00ae Six-Year Warranty\nWhen you choose CDL-series loudspeakers and subwoofers, you choose confidence. Rest assured that your PreSonus\u00ae speakers are in it for the long haul. We take our build quality seriously, and if anything goes wrong with them in your first six years of ownership (assuming you don\u2019t abuse them), the repair or replacement is on us.\nSpecs\nElectronics\nAuxiliary Input\nN/A\nChannels\nOne\nInputs\nOne - 1 XLR\nLine Out\nOne - Direct Line Out (XLR)\nPower Consumption\n4.2A\nVoltageRequirements\n100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz\nGeneral\nAmplifier Type\nClass-D\nColor\nBlack\nProduct Name\nCDL10P Constant Directivity Sound Reinforcement Loudspeaker, Black\nSeries\nCDL\nHardware\nAudio Controls\nPreset Select for number of arrayed boxes\nHPF On/Off\nPreSonus Subwoofer Configuration\nCabinet Material\nMolded Plastic\nCooling\nFree Air Convection\nGrille Material\nPowder-Coated Steel\nHF Powere\n1000W Peak, 500W Program (250W RMS)\nHandle\n2 Side\nLF Power\n1000W Peak, 500W Program (250W RMS)\nLF Transducers\n10\u201d (2\u201d Voice Coil)\nPole Socket\nDual Position (0\u02da, 7.5\u02da)\nMeasurements\nProduct Depth\n16\" (40.6 cm)\nProduct Height\n14.3\" (36.3 cm)\nProduct Width\n19.6\u201d (49.78 cm)\nMiscellaneous\nPower Cable\npowerCON\u2122 In and Out\nProtections\nAmplifier: Over-Current, DC, Over/Under-Voltage, Over-Temperature, High Frequency,\nTransducer: Limiter\nSuspension\nIntegrated Rigging (10:1 Load)\nPerformance\nPeak SPL\n130 dB\nTotal Power Output\n2000W Peak, 1000W Program (500W RMS)\nSpeakers\nCoverage Pattern\n120 degree (H) x 15 degree (V)\nCrossover Frequency\n420 Hz\nSpeaker Type\nPowered 2-Way, Full-Range\nTotal Impedance\nNA",

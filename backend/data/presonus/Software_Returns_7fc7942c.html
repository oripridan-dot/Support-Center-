<p><strong><em>NOTE: This policy applies only to perpetual licenses only - subscription payments are not subject to the following.</em></strong></p>
<p>We at PreSonus are happy to offer a 14-day window after purchase during which, you are able to return any digital software purchase on our site. </p>
<p>However, it should be noted that during your purchase you will be informed at the point of sale that this 14-day window will only be available from the date of purchase up to the end of the 14-day window thereafter, or once you have activated the software, whichever is sooner. In other words, by activating the software prior to the end of the 14-day return window, you are waiving the remainder of the 14-day return window.</p>
<p>European Union and United Kingdom law provides a right of withdrawal on software sales. This right of withdrawal is excluded for digitally provided software once it has been distributed to you, the end user. This occurs when you make a purchase from PreSonus: The EU/UK statutory right of withdrawal ends 14 days after your purchase or the moment you start downloading or streaming the software for the first time, whichever is sooner. In other words, by downloading or streaming the software prior to the end of the 14-day withdrawal window, you are waiving the remainder of the 14-day withdrawal window.</p>
<p>PreSonus endeavors to offer a refund program to its customers worldwide in a way that is much more customer-focused than basic legal obligations require. For all software sales, we allow you the ability to download the software without removing your right of withdrawal. Your right of withdrawal is removed once you activate your software or after the 14-day period, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>Even when the right of withdrawal ends, you may still request a refund of your software purchase pursuant to the rest of our refund policy. We will happily review your request and decide within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>Due to EU/UK regulations, we are obligated to inform you of the right of withdrawal in very specific legal terms, which you can find below. If these should in any way differ from the above informal wording, the below terms shall prevail with respect to any EU/UK consumer.</p>
<h3>RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</h3>
<p>As a PreSonus consumer domiciled in a European Union member state or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, you have the right to withdraw from any purchase on the PreSonus Shop without giving any reason.</p>
<p>For any digital content purchased online, you have agreed upon checkout that the withdrawal period will expire 14 days after you purchase such digital content or when you start downloading the content for the first time, whichever is sooner.</p>
<p>To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform PreSonus Audio Electronics of your decision to withdraw from the purchase by an unequivocal statement (e.g. by a letter sent to PreSonus Audio Electronics, 18011 Grand Bay Court, Baton Rouge, LA 70809, USA). You may attach the model withdrawal form available below, but it is not mandatory.</p>
<p>The easiest way to exercise your right of withdrawal is by using our <a href="https://my.presonus.com/support/open">Contact Us</a> webpage. If you do so, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by email) within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.</p>
<h3>EFFECTS OF WITHDRAWAL</h3>
<p>If you should exercise your right of withdrawal, PreSonus shall reimburse to you all payments received from you without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. PreSonus will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>
<h3>EXCEPTIONS FROM THE RIGHT OF WITHDRAWAL</h3>
<p>The statutory right of withdrawal is not applicable as regards to the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Service contracts after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent, and with the acknowledgment that he will lose his right of withdrawal once the contract has been fully performed by the trader;</p>

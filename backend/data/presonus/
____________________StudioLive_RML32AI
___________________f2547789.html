StudioLive RML32AI mixers offer 24 mic inputs and 8 combo mic\/line inputs and are expandable up to 64 channels. Flawlessly integrated with state-of-the-art software, they boast an integrated multitrack recording interface, advanced AVB or Dante networking, and multiple control options. Yet they’re easy to use, with a workflow that will let you focus on mixing, without being distracted by the technology.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful, real-time, wired and Wi-Fi networking enables recording and remote control over all StudioLive RML32AI features. Use the included AVB networking connection or choose optional Dante networking. Control your StudioLive RML32AI wirelessly from anywhere in the venue using free Mac®, Windows®, and iOS® software. Network the RML32AI to a StudioLive AI-series front-of-house console, using the rack-mount mixer as a stage box and monitor mixer. Send and receive networked audio via optional Dante for multitrack recording. Connect to hundreds of Dante-enabled products. Once you’ve used a networked StudioLive RML32AI, you’ll never go back to the old way of mixing!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to PreSonus Active Integration, StudioLive RML32AI mixers can be controlled in multiple ways simultaneously so you can customize your system to suit your needs and workflow. Control the mixer over a wired or wireless network using an array of integrated software for Mac, Windows, and iPad. Add physical control with PreSonus’ StudioLive CS18AI Ethernet\/AVB control surface, which features high-quality, touch-sensitive, motorized faders and far more mixer-control features than we can list here—and can control Studio One, too!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePreSonus StudioLive RML-series mixers are tightly integrated with an entire suite of state-of-the-art software. Mix wirelessly or over a wired network from anywhere using UC Surface touch-control software for Mac, Windows, and iPad®. Remote control the mixer’s recallable XMAX preamps and Fat Channel processing with Studio One® Artist for low-latency recording with effects. Musicians control their monitor mixes onstage with QMix®-UC for iPhone®\/iPod® touch and Android™ devices. Completely automate virtual soundchecks and record shows at up to 96 kHz with Capture™. Tune your system to the room and watch for problems in your mix with UC Surface’s integrated Smaart® wizards, RTA, and spectrograph. Save mixer scenes with your live recordings in Capture and edit both in Studio One Artist. StudioLive RML-series mixers and software work together to form a cohesive ecosystem that helps you achieve your creative vision.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe StudioLive RML32AI’s built-in 54x34 multitrack recording interface is tightly integrated with the rest of the mixer—not an afterthought we tacked on. All 32 channels and your choice of buses continuously stream to your FireWire- or Dante™-connected Mac or PC. Each channel can independently access its analog input or its dedicated digital return from your computer. And with StudioLive RML mixers, recording is simple and easy: Just launch the included, preconfigured Capture™ software for one-click recording of all channel inputs and your main mix. Or record with the included Studio One Artist DAW—or any recording software that supports ASIO or Core Audio. Now you can record in the studio or at the gig with equal ease—only with StudioLive.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudioLive RML mixers provide more DSP power than any other mixer in their class. There are no limitations, no shared resources, no figuring out what processing is available where. You have all of the processing available at all times, with no compromises or caveats. The unique Fat Channel provides a compressor, limiter, expander\/gate, and parametric EQ on every channel and bus; a highpass filter on each channel; a library of professionally crafted, useful presets; and the ability to save, selectively recall, and A\/B-compare processor settings. You also get four effects processors—two reverbs and two delays—each with their own dedicated mix bus; 15 dedicated 31-band graphic EQs; and 500 ms of delay available on the last four mix outputs.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOnly StudioLive Active Integration mixers let you create a large-format console on a small-format budget. Connect two StudioLive RML32AIs or an RML32AI and an RML16AI via AVB to create up to a 64-channel mixing system. Rack-mount them together, place one on each side of the stage, or put one onstage and one at front-of-house. Record all 64 channels with free Capture™ software and have single-window control of all channels using UC Surface control software. Or enjoy up to 86x66 recording via FireWire with a DAW, such as Studio One. The Mix outputs are conveniently mirrored on both RML mixers. Now your system can grow with your needs and budget!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eConnect a StudioLive RML mixer and you’ll instantly hear details and an open high end you’d expect to find only in an expensive studio console. StudioLive RML mixers operate at up to 96 kHz for high-definition mixing and recording. They use the same high-quality 64-bit summing engine found in our Studio One® DAW, which consistently receives rave reviews for sound quality. High-quality Burr-Brown converters on every input and output provide a best-in-class 118 dB of dynamic range so you’ll catch every high and low with great accuracy and no audible distortion. And our recallable XMAX™ microphone preamps deliver incredibly high headroom, deep lows, smooth highs, and a rich overall sound.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eView the front of a StudioLive RML-series rack-mount mixer, and you’ll see a straightforward jackfield with 32 locking XLR channel inputs, the last 8 of which are combo XLR mic\/TRS line inputs, plus 16 XLR Mix outputs and other important connections. The Mix outputs on the front panel are mirrored in a pair of DB25 connectors (Mix Outs 1-8 and 9-16) on the rear. You never have to guess which input feeds which channel or which aux mix goes to an output because they’re always the same. It’s all part of a design that enables you to work quickly and without confusion.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePowerful networking and wireless remote control is great—but what if someone tries to hack into your Wi-Fi system and take control of the show or that jokester bass player tries to use his iPhone to mess with the lead singer’s monitor mix? There’s an app for that!\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis suite of plug-ins adds a wealth of fresh virtual instruments and effects to Studio One. Cherry-picked from the first names in virtual instruments and effects, each plug-in brings a different flavor of practical magic to your songs. These plug-ins aren't gimmicky one-trick ponies — these are real-deal workhorses that you'll rely on for countless mixes.\u003c\/p\u003e","published_at":"2024-09-30T14:04:18-07:00","created_at":"2024-09-30T14:04:18-07:00","vendor":"PreSonus","type":"","tags":["archived","digital-console-mixers","mixers","studiolive-series-iii"],"price":1,"price_min":1,"price_max":1,"available":true,"price_varies":false,"compare_at_price":1,"compare_at_price_min":1,"compare_at_price_max":1,"compare_at_price_varies":false,"variants":[{"id":47819755028713,"title":"Default Title","option1":"Default Title","option2":null,"option3":null,"sku":"RML32AI","requires_shipping":true,"taxable":true,"featured_image":{"id":43778108129513,"product_id":8770222325993,"position":1,"created_at":"2024-10-18T23:01:14-07:00","updated_at":"2024-10-18T23:01:16-07:00","alt":null,"width":3000,"height":1107,"src":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_frt_1_nr.png?v=1729317676","variant_ids":[47819755028713]},"available":true,"name":"StudioLive RML32AI","public_title":null,"options":["Default Title"],"price":1,"weight":0,"compare_at_price":1,"inventory_management":null,"barcode":"673454004803","featured_media":{"alt":null,"id":36186087948521,"position":1,"preview_image":{"aspect_ratio":2.71,"height":1107,"width":3000,"src":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_frt_1_nr.png?v=1729317676"}},"requires_selling_plan":false,"selling_plan_allocations":[],"quantity_rule":{"min":1,"max":null,"increment":1}}],"images":["\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_frt_1_nr.png?v=1729317676","\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_bck_1_nr.png?v=1729317676"],"featured_image":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_frt_1_nr.png?v=1729317676","options":["Title"],"media":[{"alt":null,"id":36186087948521,"position":1,"preview_image":{"aspect_ratio":2.71,"height":1107,"width":3000,"src":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_frt_1_nr.png?v=1729317676"},"aspect_ratio":2.71,"height":1107,"media_type":"image","src":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_frt_1_nr.png?v=1729317676","width":3000},{"alt":null,"id":36186088046825,"position":2,"preview_image":{"aspect_ratio":2.477,"height":1211,"width":3000,"src":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_bck_1_nr.png?v=1729317676"},"aspect_ratio":2.477,"height":1211,"media_type":"image","src":"\/\/www.presonus.com\/cdn\/shop\/files\/RML32AI_pre_mix_bck_1_nr.png?v=1729317676","width":3000}],"requires_selling_plan":false,"selling_plan_groups":[],"content":"\u003cp\u003eEqually at home in houses of worship, schools, broadcast facilities, live venues, touring rigs, and recording studios, the PreSonus® StudioLive® RML32AI 32-channel, 25-bus, rack-mount Active Integration™ digital mixer is a versatile and flexible solution for live sound and recording.

        "description": "Equally at home in houses of worship, schools, broadcast facilities, live venues, touring rigs, and recording studios, the PreSonus® StudioLive® RML32AI 32-channel, 25-bus, rack-mount Active Integration™ digital mixer is a versatile and flexible solution for live sound and recording. StudioLive RML32AI mixers offer 24 mic inputs and 8 combo mic\/line inputs and are expandable up to 64 channels. Flawlessly integrated with state-of-the-art software, they boast an integrated multitrack recording interface, advanced AVB or Dante networking, and multiple control options. Yet they’re easy to use, with a workflow that will let you focus on mixing, without being distracted by the technology.\nPowerful, real-time, wired and Wi-Fi networking enables recording and remote control over all StudioLive RML32AI features. Use the included AVB networking connection or choose optional Dante networking. Control your StudioLive RML32AI wirelessly from anywhere in the venue using free Mac®, Windows®, and iOS® software. Network the RML32AI to a StudioLive AI-series front-of-house console, using the rack-mount mixer as a stage box and monitor mixer. Send and receive networked audio via optional Dante for multitrack recording. Connect to hundreds of Dante-enabled products. Once you’ve used a networked StudioLive RML32AI, you’ll never go back to the old way of mixing!\nThanks to PreSonus Active Integration, StudioLive RML32AI mixers can be controlled in multiple ways simultaneously so you can customize your system to suit your needs and workflow. Control the mixer over a wired or wireless network using an array of integrated software for Mac, Windows, and iPad. Add physical control with PreSonus’ StudioLive CS18AI Ethernet\/AVB control surface, which features high-quality, touch-sensitive, motorized faders and far more mixer-control features than we can list here—and can control Studio One, too!\nPreSonus StudioLive RML-series mixers are tightly integrated with an entire suite of state-of-the-art software. Mix wirelessly or over a wired network from anywhere using UC Surface touch-control software for Mac, Windows, and iPad®. Remote control the mixer’s recallable XMAX preamps and Fat Channel processing with Studio One® Artist for low-latency recording with effects. Musicians control their monitor mixes onstage with QMix®-UC for iPhone®\/iPod® touch and Android™ devices. Completely automate virtual soundchecks and record shows at up to 96 kHz with Capture™. Tune your system to the room and watch for problems in your mix with UC Surface’s integrated Smaart® wizards, RTA, and spectrograph. Save mixer scenes with your live recordings in Capture and edit both in Studio One Artist. StudioLive RML-series mixers and software work together to form a cohesive ecosystem that helps you achieve your creative vision.\nThe StudioLive RML32AI’s built-in 54x34 multitrack recording interface is tightly integrated with the rest of the mixer—not an afterthought we tacked on. All 32 channels and your choice of buses continuously stream to your FireWire- or Dante™-connected Mac or PC. Each channel can independently access its analog input or its dedicated digital return from your computer. And with StudioLive RML mixers, recording is simple and easy: Just launch the included, preconfigured Capture™ software for one-click recording of all channel inputs and your main mix. Or record with the included Studio One Artist DAW—or any recording software that supports ASIO or Core Audio. Now you can record in the studio or at the gig with equal ease—only with StudioLive.\nStudioLive RML mixers provide more DSP power than any other mixer in their class. There are no limitations, no shared resources, no figuring out what processing is available where. You have all of the processing available at all times, with no compromises or caveats. The unique Fat Channel provides a compressor, limiter, expander\/gate, and parametric EQ on every channel and bus; a highpass filter on each channel; a library of professionally crafted, useful presets; and the ability to save, selectively recall, and A\/B-compare processor settings. You also get four effects processors—two reverbs and two delays—each with their own dedicated mix bus; 15 dedicated 31-band graphic EQs; and 500 ms of delay available on the last four mix outputs.\nOnly StudioLive Active Integration mixers let you create a large-format console on a small-format budget. Connect two StudioLive RML32AIs or an RML32AI and an RML16AI via AVB to create up to a 64-channel mixing system. Rack-mount them together, place one on each side of the stage, or put one onstage and one at front-of-house. Record all 64 channels with free Capture™ software and have single-window control of all channels using UC Surface control software. Or enjoy up to 86x66 recording via FireWire with a DAW, such as Studio One. The Mix outputs are conveniently mirrored on both RML mixers. Now your system can grow with your needs and budget!\nConnect a StudioLive RML mixer and you’ll instantly hear details and an open high end you’d expect to find only in an expensive studio console. StudioLive RML mixers operate at up to 96 kHz for high-definition mixing and recording. They use the same high-quality 64-bit summing engine found in our Studio One® DAW, which consistently receives rave reviews for sound quality. High-quality Burr-Brown converters on every input and output provide a best-in-class 118 dB of dynamic range so you’ll catch every high and low with great accuracy and no audible distortion. And our recallable XMAX™ microphone preamps deliver incredibly high headroom, deep lows, smooth highs, and a rich overall sound.\nView the front of a StudioLive RML-series rack-mount mixer, and you’ll see a straightforward jackfield with 32 locking XLR channel inputs, the last 8 of which are combo XLR mic\/TRS line inputs, plus 16 XLR Mix outputs and other important connections. The Mix outputs on the front panel are mirrored in a pair of DB25 connectors (Mix Outs 1-8 and 9-16) on the rear. You never have to guess which input feeds which channel or which aux mix goes to an output because they’re always the same. It’s all part of a design that enables you to work quickly and without confusion.\nPowerful networking and wireless remote control is great—but what if someone tries to hack into your Wi-Fi system and take control of the show or that jokester bass player tries to use his iPhone to mess with the lead singer’s monitor mix? There’s an app for that!\nThis suite of plug-ins adds a wealth of fresh virtual instruments and effects to Studio One. Cherry-picked from the first names in virtual instruments and effects, each plug-in brings a different flavor of practical magic to your songs. These plug-ins aren't gimmicky one-trick ponies — these are real-deal workhorses that you'll rely on for countless mixes.",

                <p>Equally at home in houses of worship, schools, broadcast facilities, live venues, touring rigs, and recording studios, the PreSonus® StudioLive® RML32AI 32-channel, 25-bus, rack-mount Active Integration™ digital mixer is a versatile and flexible solution for live sound and recording. StudioLive RML32AI mixers offer 24 mic inputs and 8 combo mic/line inputs and are expandable up to 64 channels. Flawlessly integrated with state-of-the-art software, they boast an integrated multitrack recording interface, advanced AVB or Dante networking, and multiple control options. Yet they’re easy to use, with a workflow that will let you focus on mixing, without being distracted by the technology.</p>
<p>Powerful, real-time, wired and Wi-Fi networking enables recording and remote control over all StudioLive RML32AI features. Use the included AVB networking connection or choose optional Dante networking. Control your StudioLive RML32AI wirelessly from anywhere in the venue using free Mac®, Windows®, and iOS® software. Network the RML32AI to a StudioLive AI-series front-of-house console, using the rack-mount mixer as a stage box and monitor mixer. Send and receive networked audio via optional Dante for multitrack recording. Connect to hundreds of Dante-enabled products. Once you’ve used a networked StudioLive RML32AI, you’ll never go back to the old way of mixing!</p>
<p>Thanks to PreSonus Active Integration, StudioLive RML32AI mixers can be controlled in multiple ways simultaneously so you can customize your system to suit your needs and workflow. Control the mixer over a wired or wireless network using an array of integrated software for Mac, Windows, and iPad. Add physical control with PreSonus’ StudioLive CS18AI Ethernet/AVB control surface, which features high-quality, touch-sensitive, motorized faders and far more mixer-control features than we can list here—and can control Studio One, too!</p>
<p>PreSonus StudioLive RML-series mixers are tightly integrated with an entire suite of state-of-the-art software. Mix wirelessly or over a wired network from anywhere using UC Surface touch-control software for Mac, Windows, and iPad®. Remote control the mixer’s recallable XMAX preamps and Fat Channel processing with Studio One® Artist for low-latency recording with effects. Musicians control their monitor mixes onstage with QMix®-UC for iPhone®/iPod® touch and Android™ devices. Completely automate virtual soundchecks and record shows at up to 96 kHz with Capture™. Tune your system to the room and watch for problems in your mix with UC Surface’s integrated Smaart® wizards, RTA, and spectrograph. Save mixer scenes with your live recordings in Capture and edit both in Studio One Artist. StudioLive RML-series mixers and software work together to form a cohesive ecosystem that helps you achieve your creative vision.</p>
<p>The StudioLive RML32AI’s built-in 54x34 multitrack recording interface is tightly integrated with the rest of the mixer—not an afterthought we tacked on. All 32 channels and your choice of buses continuously stream to your FireWire- or Dante™-connected Mac or PC. Each channel can independently access its analog input or its dedicated digital return from your computer. And with StudioLive RML mixers, recording is simple and easy: Just launch the included, preconfigured Capture™ software for one-click recording of all channel inputs and your main mix. Or record with the included Studio One Artist DAW—or any recording software that supports ASIO or Core Audio. Now you can record in the studio or at the gig with equal ease—only with StudioLive.</p>
<p>StudioLive RML mixers provide more DSP power than any other mixer in their class. There are no limitations, no shared resources, no figuring out what processing is available where. You have all of the processing available at all times, with no compromises or caveats. The unique Fat Channel provides a compressor, limiter, expander/gate, and parametric EQ on every channel and bus; a highpass filter on each channel; a library of professionally crafted, useful presets; and the ability to save, selectively recall, and A/B-compare processor settings. You also get four effects processors—two reverbs and two delays—each with their own dedicated mix bus; 15 dedicated 31-band graphic EQs; and 500 ms of delay available on the last four mix outputs.</p>
